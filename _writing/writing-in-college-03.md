Here are some steps for re-reading and revising your essays in a
reasonably objective way. These steps may seem formulaic and mechanical,
but you need a way to diagnose your own prose so that you have some
sense of how others will read it.

> ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Finding your best point---and making sure your readers can find it 

This first step is intended to ensure that the beginning and end of your
paper cohere with each other, that they "frame" your paper is an
appropriate way.

**1. Find the beginning and the end.**

Draw a line after the end of your introduction and just before the
beginning of your conclusion.

**2. Find candidates for your point.**

Underline one sentence in both your introduction and conclusion that
comes closest to expressing your main point, your claim, the thesis of
your paper. In your introduction, that sentence is most likely to be the
last one; in your conclusion, it might be anywhere.

**3. Find the *best* candidate.**

Read the introduction and conclusion together, particularly comparing
those two most important sentences. They should at least not contradict
one another.

From an introduction:

> During this unprecedented period, African-American artists shared in
> the process of creating a black urban identity through their
> depictions of a culture's experience.

From a conclusion:

> While many were eager to slash the culture's ties to its primitive
> history, Armstrong and Motley created art which included elements of
> the community's history and which made this history a central part of
> African-American urban identity.

It is likely that the sentence in your conclusion will be more specific,
more substantive, more thoughtful than the one in your introduction.
Your introduction may merely announce a general intention to write about
some topic. If so, your conclusion is more likely to make a more
important claim, generalization, or point about that topic. In the
example above, the sentence from the introduction describes only the
fairly general idea that artists contributed to a culture's identity by
depicting its experience. An important idea, certainly, but one that
your readers probably already hold. An essay that did no more than
reiterate it would not be especially valuable. Contrast the sentence
from the conclusion. Here, the writer is more specific in several
important ways. First, she is specific about one element in
African-American experience: its ties to its primitive history. She is
specific about what the artists did: they included aspects of that
history in their art. She also adds the suggestive information that some
people opposed including primitive history in African-American culture
("While many eager to slash the culture's ties . ." ). This controversy
is potentially enriching for the essay because it may prompt the reader
(and the writer) to analyze the subject from a very different
perspective.

**4. Revise your introduction to match the best point.**

If you find that the sentence from your conclusion is more insightful
than the one from your introduction, then you have to revise your
introduction to make it seem that you had this sentence in mind all
along (even though when you started drafting the paper you may have had
no idea how you were going to end it). You can do this in one of two
ways:

> > i\. Insert at the end of your introduction some version of that sentence
> > in your conclusion that comes closest to expressing your main point. You
> > may have to revise the rest of the introduction to make it fit.
> >
> > ii\. If you don't want to "give away" the point of your paper at the
> > beginning, insert a sentence at the end of your introduction that at
> > least anticipates your point by using some of its same language.

For example:

> As African-American artists such as Louis Armstrong and Archibald
> Motley, Jr. shared in the collective process of creating a black urban
> identity, they reflected their community's struggle to define the
> role of historical experience in modern culture.

Note that this sentence does not conclude that Armstrong and Motley did
include primitive history in their art. But it does introduce some
implicit questions that anticipate that conclusion: did these artists
use their historical experience? If so, how? Those implicit question set
up the explicit point.

How do you choose between stating your main point at the beginning of
the essay or waiting to state it at the end? If you think you are a
skilled writer, the second choice---the "point-last" strategy---is a
possibility. You must be certain, though, that the rest of the paper
plausibly takes your reader to your conclusion. (We'll talk more about
that in a minute.) Point-last writing, however, is always more difficult
that point-first, and if you feel uncertain about your writing or more
important, if you aren't interested in spending the extra time it takes
to write good point-last prose, then you should state your main point
explicitly at the end of your introduction. If you've stated your main
point at the beginning of your essay, your reader won't lose track of
your argument, won't lose the sense of where you are headed. More
important, it will focus *your* attention on where you are headed.
Don't worry that if you state your point first your professors will
lose interest in your paper. If your point is interesting (or even if
it's not), they will read on to see how you support it. (That, after
all, is what you're paying them to do.)

There are, to be sure, some instructors, mostly but not exclusively in
the humanities, who prefer point-last papers: papers that pose a problem
in their introductions, then work toward a conclusion, demonstrating how
the writer thought about the topic, wrestled with alternative answers,
and finally discovered a solution. That kind of organization creates a
dramatic tension that some instructors like, because they want to see
the processes of your thinking.

The risk is that you might do exactly that! For nearly all of us, the
process of our thinking is messy, inefficient, hard to follow. If you
write a paper that in fact tracks what you thought about at 1 AM, then 3
AM, the 6 AM, you're likely to write a messy, inefficient and hard to
follow paper. Few instructors want to see that. They want to see a
coherent, ordered, analytical account of your thinking that may *seem*
to be a narrative, but in fact is always an artful invention, something
that requires writing skills of a high order.

So when you go through this first phase of your analysis, you have to
make a thoughtful choice about where you want to locate your point---in
your introduction *and* your conclusion, or just in your conclusion,
with an "anticipatory" point in your introduction. The default choice
for both writer and reader is the first: point-first.

> ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Creating coherent sections 

Now you need to determine whether the parts of your paper hang together
to form a coherent argument and whether the parts are in an order that
will seem to make sense to your reader.

**1. Find the paper's major sections.**

Draw a line between every major section in your paper. A four or five
page paper should have at least two and probably not more than three or
four.

Now, analyze and revise each section as you did your whole paper:

**2. Find each section's introduction and conclusion.**

Put a slash mark after the introduction to each section. The
introduction to a section may be only one sentence or it may be a
complete paragraph. Each section needs a sentence that tells your
readers that they have finished one segment of your argument and are
moving on to another.

Put a slash mark before the conclusion to each major section. If your
sections are short---only a couple of paragraphs or less---that section
might not need a separate conclusion.

**3. Identify the major point in each section.**

Just as your whole paper has to have a point, so should each section
have a sentence that offers some generalization, some point, some claim
that that section is intended to support.

If most of your points seem to be at the beginnings of your sections,
fine. If most of them are at the ends of your sections as conclusions,
you have to . . .

**4. Think hard about whether you want any particular section to be
point-last.**

If you can think of no good reason, revise so that that section is point
first. If you decide that you want the section to be point-last, then
you'll have to repeat for the section the process we described for a
point-last essay. You'll need to write an introductory sentence for the
section that uses some of the key words that will appear in the point
sentence that concludes the section. This principle simply reflects the
needs of readers to know where they are and where they are going.
Nothing confuses a reader more than moving from paragraph to paragraph
with no sense of the logical progression of your argument. Such an essay
feels like pudding with an occasional raisin to chew on, but not in any
particular order.

**5. Ordering the sections.**

Try to explain to yourself why you put the parts of the paper in the
order you did. If you arranged the parts of your paper in the order you
did because that's the order in which they occurred to you, your
readers are likely not to see any rationale for moving through your
paper in the order they do.

-   If you have three (or four, or whatever) reasons for something, why
    are the reasons in the order they are in? (By the way, beware of
    organization-by-number: ". . . for three reasons. First . . . Second
    . . . Third . . ." If the *only* relationship you can demonstrate
    among your arguments is "first-second-third," your essay will
    probably be perceived as unsophisticated. Most significant arguments
    have substantive relationships: they are related not merely by
    number but by content.)
-   If you have ordered the parts of your paper from cause-to-effect,
    why did you do that? Why not effect-to-cause?
-   If you organized your paper to echo the organization of the text you
    are writing about, why have you done that? If you did, you risk
    having written a mere summary.
-   If you organized your paper to match the terms of the assignment, is
    that what your instructor wanted, or did your instructor want
    something more original from you?
-   If you organized your paper around major topics in your assignment
    ("Compare and contrast Freud and Jung in terms of the role of
    society in the development of their theories") did you write about,
    say, Freud first and Jung second simply because that was the order
    in the assignment?

There are so many principles of order that we cannot list them all here.
We can only urge you to identify the one you chose and then to justify
it as the best one from among the many possible.

### Ensuring your evidence fits your claims 

The most common evidence you will offer to support your claims will be
quotations from the texts you read and references to passages in them.
Without such evidence, your claims are merely statements of opinion. As
we said, you are entitled to your opinions but you're not entitled to
having your readers agree with them. In fact, your readers generally
will not highly value your opinions unless you provide some evidence to
support them. When you provide evidence, you turn your opinions into
arguments.

But before readers can value your claim as supported with evidence, they
must first understand how your evidence *counts* as evidence for that
claim. No flaw more afflicts the papers of less experienced writers than
to make some sort of claim, or to offer a quotation from the text, and
*assume* that the reader understands how the quotations speaks to the
claim. Here is an example:

> Lincoln believed that the Founders would have supported the North,
> because as he said, this country was "dedicated to the proposition
> that all men are created equal."

The writer may be correct that Lincoln believed that the Founders would
have supported the North, but what in that quotation would cause a
reader to agree? In other words, how does the quotation count as
evidence of the claim? The evidence says something about the views of
the founders in 1776. How does that support a claim about what the
founders would think about 1863? When pressed, the writer explained:
"Since the Founders dedicated the country to the proposition that all
men are created equal and Lincoln freed the slaves because he thought
they were created equal, then he must have thought that he and the
Founders agreed, so they would have supported the North. *It's
obvious.*"

Well, it's not. After it has been explained, it may or may not be
persuasive (after all, the author of "all men are create equal" was
himself a slave owner). But it isn't obvious. Quotations rarely speak
for themselves; most have to be "unpacked." If you offer only quotes
without interpreting those quotes, your reader will likely have trouble
understanding how the quote, as evidence, supports your claim. Your
paper will seem to be a pastiche of strung-together quotations,
suggesting that your data never passed through the critical analysis of
a working mind.

Whenever you support a claim with numbers, charts, pictures, and
especially quotations---whatever looks like primary data---do not
assume that what you see is what your readers will get. Spell out for
them how it is that the data counts as evidence for your claim. For a
quotation, a good principle is to use a few of its key words just before
or after it. Something like this:

> Lincoln believed that the Founders would have supported the North
> because they would have supported his attempt to move the slaves to a
> more equal position. He echoes the Founder's own language when he
> says that the country was "dedicated to the proposition that all men
> are created equal."

### Making your case without oversimplifying it 

Some inexperienced writers think that the strongest and most persuasive
kind of writing projects a voice of utter confidence, complete
certainty, no room for doubt of the possibility of seeing things in a
different way. That view could not be more mistaken. If communicating
with your readers is like having a serious, mutually respectful
conversation with them, then the last kind of person you want to talk
with is someone who is

**UTTERLY CERTAIN OF EVERYTHING WITH NO QUALIFICATIONS, RESERVATIONS, OR
LIMITATIONS.**

Two minutes with such a person is at least one too many. Compare these
two passages:

> a\. For more than a century now, every liberal has vehemently argued
> against any kind of censorship of art and/or entertainment. And in the
> last 20 years, the courts and the legislatures of Western nations have
> found these arguments so persuasive that no one remembers any rebuttals
> to these arguments. Censorship has simply ceased to exist.
>
> b\. For almost a century now, many liberals have argued against the
> censorship of art and/or entertainment, and in the last 20 years, courts
> and the legislatures in most Western nations have found these arguments
> fairly persuasive. Few people now clearly remember what the rebuttals to
> these arguments were. Today, in the United States and other democracies,
> censorship has just about ceased to exist.

Twenty pages of the (a) prose would quickly grow wearisome. It is too
strident, too flat-footed, completely unnuanced. But some would say the
second is mealy mouthed, too hedged about with qualifiers. Here is a
third version, which neither proclaims nor hedges:

> c\. For a century now, liberals have been arguing against the censorship
> of art and/or entertainment, and in the last 20 years, courts and the
> legislatures in Western nations have found these arguments so persuasive
> that few now remember what the rebuttals to these arguments were. Today,
> in the United States and other democracies, *overt* censorship *by the
> central government* has *largely* ceased to exist.

It is hard to give completely reliable advice about hedging and
emphasizing because different writers have different opinions about it,
different fields do it in different ways. But something most of us share
is a sense of caution. (Notice that we said "most of us.")

Another kind of reservation you ought to make room for in your papers is
plausibly contradictory evidence. No matter what position you take on a
text, there will almost always be some evidence in it that someone can
use as a basis to disagree with you.

> Lincoln may have been willing to let his readers associate the
> Founders with the North, but it is not clear that he actually believed
> that they would have supported the Union. He does not specifically say
> so. Although he describes what the founders did in the past (Four
> score and seven years ago), he does not say what they would do in the
> present.

The shrewd writer considers these kinds of objections before readers do,
and may include the objections in the essay. Once you think you have
constructed an argument that fully supports your claim, skim your
reading again specifically looking for evidence that might support a
different conclusion. Then raise that evidence and counterclaim in order
both to acknowledge and, if you can, rebut them. Even if you can't
fully rebut them, you can suggest that the weight of evidence is still
on your side. Don't worry that including counter evidence will make
your argument less persuasive. On the contrary. While there are
exceptions, most academic readers are much more persuaded by writers who
admit reservations then by writers who insist that they are always
absolutely correct.

The point here is to avoid the kind of flat-footed, unnuanced,
unsophisticated certainty that characterizes the thinking of someone who
does not recognize that things are usually more complex, less clear-cut,
than most of us wish.

Once your arguments are polished and well-organized, you at last will
have an excellent idea of what it is that you've really said. You're
now ready to move on to those parts of the revision that can make the
most difference in the way readers experience your paper: the
introduction and conclusion. We offer some pointers on such revision in
the next section, "[Revising the introduction and conclusion, and
polishing the draft](writing-in-college-03.html)."
