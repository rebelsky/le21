### Preparing to prove your point: the process of gathering evidence 

Once you understand the assignment, your next task is to find data
relevant to meeting it. The word "data" makes some humanists flinch a
bit, but we need a word that distinguishes all the facts, quotations,
references, numbers, events that might be relevant to your assignment
from those fact, quotations, references, etc. that might support your
specific claim or point. All the information related to your assignment
is data; data becomes evidence when you use it to convince readers to
agree with your point.

We do not have the space here to discuss the process of reading
critically and selecting data, thinking about what you have gathered,
analyzing it, and discovering the point or claim that you want to make
and support. Every assignment will ask you to look at your readings in a
different way, and every text you read will raise its own problems of
interpretation and analysis. In fact, that is what most of your classes
are about: selecting and analyzing data, and arriving at a plausible
conclusion about them.

The best generic advice we can give is this:

-   Go through your readings once and mark with a highlighter
    *everything* you think plausibly relevant to answering the
    assignment.
-   So that you can get a sense of it all, go through a second time,
    skimming what you have highlighted.
-   Go through a third time, marking passages that seem *most* central
    to your assignment. Try to assign to each passage a key word that
    will help you sort them later.
-   Now try to categorize those passages according to how they might
    support different points. Which ones support one point, which ones
    support another point. (Spend the time it takes to find data that
    might support different, even opposing, points. You need such data
    so that you can critically balance one point against another.)
-   On a piece of paper, jot down what you think are the central
    concepts that emerge from this analysis.
-   To these central concepts attach subsidiary concepts. Use some sort
    of symbol to represent the kinds of relationships that the
    subsidiary concepts have to the central concepts and to one another:
    cause and effect, similarity, contrast, more important-less
    important, earlier-later in time, and so on. Spend time playing with
    these relationships. Make lists of the central concepts, order and
    re-order them, find categories and subcategories.
-   Then create a working outline around topics suggested by your
    categories of evidence.

At this point, you may have a fairly clear idea about the point you want
to make; more often, you won't. Either way, if you have even a dim idea
about the shape of your general point, prepare to start your first
draft.

### Planning your first draft: styles of outlining 

You may have been told in high school that you needed a detailed outline
before you began to draft a paper. For some writers, that's good
advice; for others it is not. Some writers can't begin writing until
they have a detailed outline consisting of their main point and every
subpoint, in the order in which they intend to make them. Other writers
need an outline of some kind, but usually only of topics so that we know
what the parts of our paper are and the order in which we want them to
appear. You will know which is right for you only after you write a few
papers.

But almost everyone profits from at least a scratch outline that focuses
your attention on particular aspects of your paper and in a particular
order:

-   Harlem Renaissance-art using experience to develop urban identity
-   African-American art muffled in rural south.
-   Migration north: transforming effect of urban life.
-   Armstrong transforms mainstream song using folk and African
    elements.
-   Significance of opposition to jazz
-   Motley transforms painting with bold color, form and subject
    (stereotypes?)
-   Clash of dignified vs. primitive

If you can formulate a complete sentence that captures the central idea
in each section, so much the better. But it is likely that you will
discover those sentences in the act of drafting, as well.

### Beginning your first draft: the draft introduction 

Every writer, beginner or experienced, feels at least some small twinge
of anxiety when it comes time to write the first sentence of a paper.
That's why some writing teachers tell you to write your introduction
last. What they mean, of course, is that after you finish a draft, you
need to go back and re-write your introduction. Once you know what
you've said in the draft, you can write a much better introduction to
it. So in that sense, you will have written the real introduction only
after you've written the draft: you'll have written the introduction
last. But even first drafts need introductions of some kind, so no one
escapes that moment of uncertainty.

It is useful to spend more than a moment or two thinking about even this
first draft introduction because it has a way of so entrenching itself
in your paper that you will have a hard time getting rid of it when you
get to your last draft. You may be resolved to get rid of your first
draft introduction later, but such a resolution can fade as your
deadline approaches---especially if sunrise is approaching at the same
time. It is not a bad idea even from the beginning to take some steps to
avoid last minute trouble.

First, here are some introductory strategies to *avoid* even in first
drafts. If they survive into your last draft, you can be sure that your
instructor will judge them amateurish.

-   **Don't simply echo the language of the assignment.** If the
    assignment says "Discuss the logical structure of the Declaration of
    Independence, particularly those assumptions on which Jefferson
    based his argument," do not start with something like, "In the
    Declaration of Independence, Jefferson based his argument on
    assumptions that are part of its logical structure." You're very
    likely to need *some* of the language from the assignment, but you
    should leave room, even in your first draft, for language of your
    own, so your readers will understand your unique approach to the
    question.
-   **Avoid offering a history of your thinking about the assignment.**
    Don't begin, "In analyzing the logical structure of the Declaration
    of Independence, it is first necessary to define the assumptions
    that Jefferson worked with. In my analysis, I found that Jefferson
    began with one assumption, which was that . . . ." Such a discussion
    of your own thought processes forces readers to wait a bit too long
    to find out what the paper will actually be about.
-   **Avoid beginning with "Webster defines 'xxx' as . . ."** If a
    concept is so important to your paper that you feel compelled to
    specify its meaning, its dictionary definition will be too generic
    for your purposes. A somewhat better strategy here is to cite a
    definition by a specialist in a particular field or by an otherwise
    admirable individual. If you wish to explore "generosity," for
    example, you are unlikely to find a good starting point for your
    paper in a dictionary's definition, but you are more likely to find
    one in philosopher's definition, or a psychologist's, or an
    economist's, or a political theorist's, or a sociobiologist's, or
    Mother Theresa's. The reason for this is that dictionaries and
    thinkers are doing quite different things when they define:
    dictionaries are merely establishing a baseline of situations to
    which a word may be applied, while thinkers are participating in an
    ongoing intellectual conversation about a concept. And it is this
    conversation that your paper seeks to join, by citing such a
    definition and then contesting it, or elaborating on it, or finding
    exceptions to it, or adding to it. What if you're not sure who
    "counts" as a participant in this conversation? In that case, you
    have two choices: you may ask someone, such as your professor or
    Writing Intern or a Writing Tutor, or you may choose to avoid this
    opening strategy altogether until you are more familiar with the
    field.
-   **Avoid beginning with grandly banal statements:** "The Declaration
    of Independence is the greatest and most logical document in
    American history. . . ." The danger here is twofold. Readers may
    find the statement too obvious to be worth reading, or (and this is
    more likely in an academic setting) they may think that it
    oversimplifies a complex matter, so much so that it cannot function
    as the beginning of an intellectually respectable argument.

**How *should* a draft introduction begin?** One way to focus your own
thinking is to begin with a kind of sentence that *you must change in
the final draft*:

> I am addressing the issue of \[\-\-\-\-\----fill in your topic here\]
> in order to show why/how/what/who/whether \[fill this in with subject
> and verb\]

For example,

> I am addressing the issue of *the relationship between Jefferson's
> assumptions and evidence* in order to show *how he depended on
> assumptions that he could not prove but needed in order to use the
> evidence he had*.

That kind of sentence focuses your attention not on what you are writing
*about*, but on what you are trying to *do*. The indirect question such
as, ". . . show *how* . . ." or ". . . explain why . . ." helps you
identify something that you do not know but are trying to find out.

If you have even a tentative answer to your question, state it at the
end of your introduction. That will launch you into the body of your
paper with some sense of direction. If you do not have a tentative
answer, make up some sentence that uses most of the key terms you came
up with when you were assembling, organizing, and analyzing your data.
(Not sure how to fit those key words into a sentence? Feel free to use
question marks, ellipses or just blank space to reflect your
uncertainty: "The evidence that Jefferson most relies on are specific
acts of tyranny (injustice?), which caused him to rely on unproven
assumptions . . . fundamental purpose of government." You can come back
to this sentence after you've written the draft to fill in the missing
pieces.)

If you can get some key terms into your draft introduction, you will
help yourself focus on developing those concepts.

Remember, after you've completed your paper draft, you'll need to
revise this first try at an introduction. We offer some suggestions in a
later section on [revising
introductions](revising_the_introduction.htm), but you'll be better
able to follow them after you've drafted the whole paper.

> ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### After your draft introduction: a common danger 

After you finish the draft introduction, your biggest risk is that
instead of laying down the foundation of your argument, you might lapse
into a long narrative summary of what you have read. The act of
producing such a summary can actually be a valuable part of your writing
process, but only if you have started your paper at least two or three
days before it is due and if you will substantially revise what you have
written. In these circumstances, your summary is a useful way to allow
you (but *not* your readers) to gain control over your subject matter.

But perhaps the most common problem that first year students have with
their papers is that they take this summary of their subject, tack on a
half-page conclusion and then turn the essay in. They may spend an hour
or two tinkering with spelling and punctuation, but essentially, once
they've written a summary of what they've read, and then added a short
conclusion, they're done. It is a pattern of behavior that many
students fall into without even noticing. Remember: if you feel you have
to summarize, start drafting at least three or four days before the
paper is due. Give yourself time not only to write the summary, but to
transform it into an argument.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Two styles of drafting: fast vs. slow 

There are two extremes in drafting styles. Some writers draft as fast as
they can make pen or keys move. Not worrying about style or correctness,
or even clarity (least of all spelling and punctuation), they try to
keep the ideas flowing. If they bog down, they note why they got stuck,
refer to their outline for their next move, and push on*.* If they are
on a roll, they do not type out quotes or footnotes: they insert just
enough to know what to do later. Then if they do freeze up, they have
things to do: fiddle with wording, add quotes, play with the
introduction, review what they've drafted, in a sentence or two
summarize the ground they have covered. As a last resort, they correct
spelling, punctuation\----anything that diverts their minds from what is
blocking them, but keeps them on task, giving their subconscious a
chance to work on the problem. Or they go for a walk.

There are others, though, who cannot work with such "sloppy" methods,
but only "word-by-perfect-word," "sentence-by-polished-sentence." They
cannot start a new sentence, until the one they are working on is dead
right. If this sounds like you, if you cannot imagine a quicker but
rougher style of drafting, do not fight it. But remember: the more you
nail down each small piece, the fewer alternatives you have thereafter.
For this reason, if you are a "sentence-by-sentence" drafter, you must
have a detailed outline that tells you where you are going and how you
will get there.

Neither of these styles is "the" correct one; both can lead to excellent
papers. Both also have built-in pitfalls of which you must be aware. The
faster style can lead to careless errors in the final draft if you fail
to proofread rigorously, and it may also degenerate into a history of
your thought process rather than a carefully structured argument if you
fail to revise it with readers' needs in mind. The slower style can
become overly focused on sentence-level correctness and neglect the
paper's overall structure; you must therefore use outlines and frequent
rereadings to remind yourself of the role each part should play in the
whole.

Whichever style is yours, establish a ritual for writing and follow it.
Ritualistically straighten up your desk, sit down, sharpen your pencils
or boot up your computer, get the light just right, knowing that you
will sit there for an absolute minimum time. If you sit staring, not an
idea in your head, write a summary: *So far, I have these points . . .
.* Or look at the last few paragraphs you wrote, and treat some
important bit of evidence as a claim in a subordinate argument.

### The crucial part of writing: revision 

When you have finished your first draft, you should have enough time
left for a few hours of revision. Ideally, you should leave enough time
to put the draft aside so that you can forget at least some of what you
were thinking when you drafted. The very worst time to revise a draft is
right after you have finished it. At that moment you are the worst
possible editor. You know too much about what you have written and are
thereby constitutionally incapacitated from reading your essay as your
readers will.

Some research at Carnegie-Mellon University suggests why. A group of
researchers created a passage on a technical subject and inserted into
it problems of organization, sentence structure, clarity, etc.. They
asked two groups of readers to read the passage and indicate where they
had trouble understanding. One group, however, was given background
reading in the subject of the passage before they read it. Which group
was better able to identify those deliberately inserted problems? The
readers *without* the background reading, of course: when the ones with
the better knowledge hit a passage with errors, they were able to bring
up from memory what they already knew. They didn't spot the errors in
the writing because they were not relying on the writing to understand
the ideas---they already understood. The ones without previous knowledge
were much more effective at spotting flaws because they were much more
attentive to the text. They had to be---without the background reading,
the only way they could understand the material was to concentrate on
the text.

At the moment you finish writing something, who knows more about it than
you do? When you re-read your own writing, you aren't really reading
it; you're only reminding yourself of what you wanted to mean when you
wrote it. That means two things:

1.  The longer you can set aside something you have written before you
    revise it, the more you will have forgotten what you were thinking
    when you wrote it. This amnesia is a blessing: it will enable you to
    read what you have written more quickly.
2.  Even then, you will still know too much. In the next section, we
    offer some ways to analyze, diagnose, and revise your own writing in
    a way that sidesteps your too-good memory of it. To see our
    suggestions for revision, go to ["A strategy for analyzing and
    revising a first draft."](writing-in-colloege-02.html)
