*Appendix A* How are things different at Grinnell? Some local notes 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

by Samuel A. Rebelsky

The preceding sections were written by faculty at the University of
Chicago for students at the University of Chicago. While many things are
the same at all institutions, you will find that some things are
different at Grinnell and in this course. Please consider these
differences as you reflect on the earlier sections.

> ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Some differences

At Chicago, writing assistance is generally handled on a fairly "local"
basis. Each dorm has a writing tutor with regular hours, and some
courses also have a designated writing tutor. These tutors are typically
graduate students from disciplines with some emphasis on writing. At
Grinnell, some writing assistance is handled at both a local basis
(through the faculty) and a College-wide basis (through the writing
lab). Grinnell also has writing mentors for some courses, including our
Tutorial.  Previous sections have been updated to reflect some of these
differences, but references to the Chicago system may still remain.

Chicago and Grinnell also have somewhat different perspectives on early
writing experiences. Chicago students are rarely called on to write
papers of less than five pages. Grinnell students often begin with one
and two page papers. Neither system is necessarily better, but you
should realize that the previous sections' emphasis on five page papers
may not always apply.

### Recommendations

At Grinnell, we expect our students to produce a serious draft of every
paper at least a few days before the paper is due. By "serious", we mean
one that is more than just free-writing or a set of notes. Your serious
draft should be a significant and serious effort at reaching your final
paper.

Once you have reached this stage, you may take advantage of the
faculty member who teaches your course, the class writing mentor
(if there is one), the staff of the writing lab, you colleagues,
or even your advisor. In all cases, your preparation of a serious
draft makes it easier for you and those helping you to bring your
paper to the high level we expect at Grinnell.

Of course, in most case you may also consult with others earlier
in the writing process. (The writing lab note that you may visit
at any stage of writing.) If you are stuck on an assignment, you
should feel free to make an appointment to visit and consider
techniques for approaching the assignment. If you've gotten started,
but are having difficulty with some part, you should also feel free
to get some help.

Often, though, you should begin by taking advantage of a group of fellow
students. We strongly recommend that you develop a set of *trusted
readers*: colleagues who you can trust to read your work, give you
helpful criticisms, but not make you feel uncomfortable. Note that there
are three attributes you should look for in these readers: they should
be willing to read your work, even if it is not always in an ideal
state; they should have the ability to give real critiques of your work,
critiques that are both detailed and that don't pull punches; they
should be trusted enough as colleagues that you feel comfortable
receiving such critiques from them. It takes some time to develop such a
group. Begin early, with your colleagues in tutorial.

### Assorted Issues

_Fonts_: Williams and McEnerney claim that serif fonts are easier to read
than sans serif fonts.  It turns out that the difference is often
cultural.  For example, Americans tend to do better reading serif
fonts and Europeans tend to do better reading sans serif fonts.
Careful studies about comprehension have been mixed.  So feel free
to choose a font you consider readable.

_Visiting the writing lab_: Williams and McEnerney reasonably suggest
that your bring two printed copies of whatever you want to discuss
to the writing lab.  Since we are online, that's not likely to be
possible.  When you meet with the writing lab or with the writing
mentors, you should simply email the paper to the person you are
working with.
