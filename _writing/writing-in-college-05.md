*Part V* But what if you get stuck? A good solution and a terrible solution

At some point, you may find yourself staring at the screen or paper,
utterly blocked. You can think of nothing to say that does not sound
stupid. You are overwhelmed by the task of assembling evidence for your
point, or you are so overwhelmed by little pieces of evidence that you
can't imagine a way to make them cohere into a single point. This
happens to everyone: the key is to find a productive way out of the
situation.

### A productive solution to a block: ways to prepare for a meeting with the writing lab 

To help with a writing block or to get suggestions for revising a draft,
you might want to visit [the writing
lab](http://www.grinnell.edu/writinglab/). The writing lab staff are
trained to help you get over crisis moments in your writing and to help
you improve their writing. While they have many hours, slots do fill up;
if you'll think you need to see one of the writing lab staff, sign up
for a slot as soon as possible.

Before you see someone for help, though, be sure that you can describe
what you have done, what not, and what parts of the task trouble you.
The clearer you can be, the better advice you will get.

First, prepare an outline that shows where your paper stands. A sentence
outline that lists main points is better than a topic outline, but any
outline is better than none. It should show which parts you have
drafted, which you are relatively sure of, and which are only guesses.
If you are at the earliest stages of research and cannot formulate an
outline, sketch your specific topic, either in a paragraph or two or as
a list of topics you have begun to investigate.

Next, prepare a clean copy of your draft (if you have one), marked to
show its key elements. Bring two copies (double-spaced). One should be
clean, ready for the writing lab staff to mark up. The other you should
mark up as follows:

1.  Make sure that you understand the assignment, and are able to
    explain it to the writing lab staff.
2.  Draw a line between the introduction and the body of the paper and
    another between the end of the body of your paper and your
    conclusion. If the body is long enough to divide into two- or
    three-page sized sections, put lines there as well.
3.  Highlight the main point of your paper. If you have divided the
    paper into sections, highlight the main point of each section.
4.  Circle the words near the end of the introduction that name the key
    concepts you will develop as themes in the rest of the paper. Then
    circle those words and words similar to them throughout.
5.  If you have divided your paper into sections three pages or longer,
    repeat steps 2 and 3 for each section.
6.  Mark in the margins any problem areas where drafting was
    particularly difficult or where you are dissatisfied with what
    you've done.

Be sure to take your assignment sheet and anything else you have in
writing from your instructor. The writing lab staff can't help you
solve every problem, but there are times when the opportunity simply to
talk out loud about your problem will help.

Before you leave, get a plan of action *in writing*. Many students
discover that while they are talking about their work, they think they
understand what to do next, but that plan evaporates a few hours later
when they sit down to work. Before you leave the lab, write a plan of
specific ways to improve your paper. If the writing lab staff does not
recommend specific actions, ask, so you can get a plan that you can
understand and can follow.

### The pitfall to avoid at all costs 

In an effort to find your way out of a block as you draft, you may risk
doing the worst thing that can happen to a writer. In the heat of
drafting, you may find yourself confidently plowing through your notes,
finding good things to say, filling up the page or screen with lots of
good words. *But those words belong to someone else.*

Plagiarism is a topic that embarrasses everyone, except, perhaps, the
successful intentional plagiarist. But every researcher needs to give it
serious thought. Some acts of plagiarism are deliberate. No one needs
help to know that it is wrong to buy a term paper, copy a paper from a
fraternity's files, or use large chunks of an article as though the
words were your own. But most plagiarism is inadvertent, because the
writer was not careful when taking notes because he does not understand
what plagiarism is, or because he is not conscious of what he is doing.

You *don't* plagiarize when you ask the writing lab staff for writing
advice. The writing lab is a service provided by the college to help you
improve your writing. But you *do* plagiarize when, intentionally or
not, you use someone else's words or ideas but fail to credit that
person:

-   You plagiarize when you paste material from the Internet into your
    own text without attribution (that may *feel* less like plagiarism
    than copying from a print source, but it is appropriating someone
    else's work and thus is plagiarism nonetheless).
-   You plagiarize even when you do credit an author but use his or her
    exact words without so indicating with quotation marks or block
    indentation.
-   You also plagiarize when you use words so close to those in your
    source, that if your work were placed next to the source, it would
    be obvious that you could not have written what you did without the
    source at your elbow.

When accused of plagiarism, some writers claim, "I must have somehow
memorized the passage. When I wrote it, I certainly thought it was my
own." That excuse convinces very few.

When you want to use the exact words you find in a source, stop and
think. Then,

-   type a quotation mark before and after, or create a block quotation;
-   record the words *exactly* as they are in the source (if you change
    anything use square brackets and ellipses to indicate changes);
-   cite the source.

Those are the first three principles of using the words of others:
unambiguously indicate where the words of your source begin and end, get
the words right (or indicate changes), and cite the source. Omit the
first or last step, and intentionally or not, you plagiarize. You also
plagiarize when you use someone else's ideas and you do not credit that
person.

It is trickier to define plagiarism when you summarize and paraphrase.
They are not the same, but they blend so seamlessly that you may not
even be aware when you are drifting from summary into paraphrase, then
across the line into plagiarism. No matter your intention, close
paraphrase may count as plagiarism, even when you cite the source*.*

For example, this next paragraph plagiarizes the last one, because it
paraphrases it so closely:

> It is harder to describe plagiarism when summary and paraphrase are
> involved, because while they differ, their boundaries blur, and a
> writer may not know that she has crossed the boundary from summary to
> paraphrase and from paraphrase to plagiarism. Regardless of intention,
> a close paraphrase is plagiarism, even when the source is cited.

This is borderline plagiarism:

> Because it is difficult to distinguish the border between summary and
> paraphrase, a writer can drift dangerously close to plagiarism without
> knowing it, even when the writer cites a source and never meant to
> plagiarize.

The words in both these versions track the original so closely that any
reader would recognize that the writer could have written them only
while *simultaneously* reading the original. Here is a summary of that
paragraph, just this side of the border:

> According to Williams and McEnerney, writers sometimes plagiarize
> unconsciously because they think they are summarizing, when in fact
> they are closely paraphrasing, an act that counts as plagiarism, even
> when done unintentionally and sources are cited (p. xx).

Here is a simple test for inadvertent plagiarism: be conscious of where
your eyes are as you put words on paper or on a screen. If your eyes are
on your source at the same moment your fingers are flying across the
keyboard, you risk doing something that weeks, months, even years later
could result in your public humiliation. Whenever you use a source
extensively, compare your page with the original. If you think someone
could run her finger along your sentences and find synonyms or
synonymous phrases for words in the original in roughly the same order,
try again. You are least likely to plagiarize inadvertently if as you
write, you keep your eyes not on your source, but on the screen or on
your own page, and you report what your source has to say after those
words have filtered through your own understanding of them.

We take plagiarism seriously because it is a kind of theft: By not
acknowledging a source, the plagiarist steals some of the little reward
that an academic community has to offer, the enhanced respect that a
researcher spends a lifetime trying to earn. The plagiarist steals from
his community of classmates by making the quality of their work seem
worse by comparison and then perhaps steals again by taking one of the
few good grades reserved to reward those who do good work. By choosing
not to learn the skills that research can teach him, the plagiarist not
only compromises his own education but steals from the larger community
that devotes its resources to training students to do reliable work
later.

But plagiarism is worse than mere theft, because like theft among
friends, it shreds the fabric of community. When intellectual thievery
becomes common, the community grows suspicious, then distrustful, then
cynical&emdash;*So who cares? everyone does it.* Members of the community
then have to worry as much about not being tricked as about teaching and
learning.

### Good luck 

Here at the end, we can say only if you are like many students no part
of your education will prove more useful to you than your ability to
write well and quickly. When we have asked graduates of the College what
they value most about their education here, they invariably mention
three things: the ability to think critically, the ability to solve
problems, and the ability to write well. We believe that these three
things are part of the same thing.
