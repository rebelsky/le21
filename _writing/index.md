# Writing in College

This is a local copy of "Writing in College" by Joseph Williams and
Lawrence McEnerney. That document was once available online at
<http://writing-program.uchicago.edu/resources/collegewriting/index.htm> but
appears to have disapeared from the Web.  I have copied that document
for Grinnell
with permission of the
Writing Laboratory at the University of Chicago. (Permission obtained in
1999.)  I have also made some changes to the document to slightly improve the 
printed copy.  You can find this PDF version at
<http://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu//Courses/Tutorial/2020F/files/writing-in-college.pdf>.

The original guide was intended to help first and second year students at
the University of Chicago write effective papers in the Humanities Core
and Social Sciences Core.  I updated it for students in my Tutorial.
If you wish to learn more about the principles
of organization and argumentation you find here, you may consult with
the staff of [Grinnell's writing
lab](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/centers-programs-and-resources/writing-lab), with the Writing Mentors for our Tutorial, or with me (SamR).
