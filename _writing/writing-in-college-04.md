*Part IV* Revising the introduction and conclusion, and polishing the draft

If you are satisfied that you have made a claim, supported and qualified
it; that the parts of your paper hang together, you are probably ready
to write your last draft introduction and conclusion. These are
important, because the first thing your reader reads creates a "frame"
through which your reader reads, understands, and interprets everything
that follows. Your conclusion is your last opportunity to shape your
reader's *memory* of your paper.

### Effective introductions 

We've already touched on your decision whether to state your point at
the end of your introduction and in your conclusion, or whether to end
your introduction with a kind of "anticipatory, jumping-off" point that
only launches the reader into the body of the paper but does not reveal
the full contours of your claim. There are advantages and disadvantages
to both, as we have indicated in the section on [drafting
introductions](preparing.html). Whichever strategy you choose, you have
to use your introduction to lead up to either your main point sentence
or to that launching-point sentence.

The most important role of your introduction is to give a brief
statement about the question or problem that you are answering or
solving. You do this by suggesting something that is puzzling, not
entirely understood, perhaps overlooked, not noticed, undervalued. The
intention is to make your reader feel that you have answered a question
that is worth asking, that you have seen something that helps make sense
out of a reading. Here are two introductions the first typical, the
second not. They both respond to an assignment asking students to
discuss ways in which Tolstoy used the French language to critique
social and cultural values in *War and Peace*.

> a\. In *War and Peace*, Tolstoy portrays many aspects of Russian society.
> One of the most important and interesting of these is the role of the
> French language. Throughout the book, many characters speak French,
> although this is the language of their enemy. Later on in the book, the
> Russians are concerned about using French and begin to learn and use
> Russian. This very significant shift in the language of the characters
> indicates some of Tolstoy's views about the values contained in Russian
> culture. By comparing the use of the French language throughout *War and
> Peace*, Tolstoy's views of culture can be examined.
>
> b\. Throughout *War and Peace*, the French language is linked to a range
> of negative themes. In the opening scene, superficial characters at the
> soiree reveal their artificiality and insincerity through their
> ostentatious use of French. Those characters who are the most adept at
> French tend to be the most concerned with social appearances, those who
> speak Russian are usually associated with honesty and unselfishness. It
> is notable that those Russians who speak French incorrectly are good,
> straightforward, kindhearted souls while those who smirk at their
> virtues speak flawless French. It is misleading, however, to conclude
> that there is a simple association between negative values and the
> French language. Although it may seem that French itself reveals a
> character's superficiality or viciousness, this is not always the case.
> Very often, Tolstoy uses French in conjunction with irony, paradox or
> other literary techniques. The French language is not the main vehicle
> of Tolstoy's cultural criticism, rather, it is more of a parasite that
> lives off of other devices, a virus that intensifies their effect.

The tone to avoid at all costs is the tone of that first one: "Well," it
says, "you asked me to write about French in *War and Peace*, so I will.
You said that Tolstoy uses French to criticize certain values, so I'll
repeat that. You seem to think this matters, so I'll say that it is
'important,' 'interesting,' and 'very significant.' Then I'll
cite lots of places in the text where Tolstoy uses French to criticize
values. Isn't that what you want?" No. Mostly, this is not what they
want. The first introduction makes the paper seem merely a report on a
topic: the paper will report on the places where the writer found
Tolstoy using French to criticize values. There is no sense of the
writer having thought much about *War and Peace* because the paper seems
to answer no question, resolve no puzzle, solve no problem. In the
second introduction, the writer suggests that there is something
difficult to understand about the way Tolstoy uses French in *War and
Peace*. This writer suggests that what appears to be true about the link
between French and values may be a misunderstanding of the text. Where
the first writer positions her paper as a list of citations from the
text, the second writer positions her paper as an effort to enhance our
understanding.

As the very first sentences in your introduction, you might try to find
a quotation in the text that you can say inspired your question or
raises your problem, a quotation that you can balance with one at the
end of your conclusion.

### Effective conclusions 

Your conclusion is the easiest to revise, because you will probably have
already written a conclusion that makes a good point. Most of us write
to discover, and it is at the end where we discover our most interesting
ideas. We have to make sure our introductions cohere with our
conclusions, but for the most part, our conclusions will be the richest,
most complex part of our paper, because that is where we are prepared to
do our richest and most complex thinking.

In addition to stating---or restating---the main point, usually as the
first or second sentence of the conclusion, most writers want to go
beyond it. They can do that in two ways:

-   They can suggest the significance of their conclusion. They do that
    by suggesting the consequences of answering the question they asked,
    solving the problem they posed. In effect, they answer the question
    "So what?" Try that as a strategy of revision: State your main
    point, and then have someone ask, "So what?" If you can answer that
    question, you have identified the significance of your point.

    The following is a conclusion from a paper whose main point was that
    the character Kurtz in *Heart of Darkness* did not accomplish a
    "moral victory." But as you'll see, the writer ended the essay not
    only by restating this point but also by suggesting that this
    problem of Kurtz's morality has implications for another problem:
    the problem of whether *Heart of Darkness* is a racist text.

    > The contrast between Kurtz and Nietzsche's Superman has shown
    > that Kurtz did not achieve any kind of 'moral victory' by being
    > true to his nature. On the contrary, Conrad has shown in Kurtz the
    > moral defeat not only of one individual but of European
    > civilization in general. One implication of this defeat stems from
    > the fact that it is highlighted by the contrast between the
    > hypocrisy of the Europeans and utter honesty of the savages. Those
    > who have denounced *Heart of Darkness* as racist seem to assume
    > that Conrad denigrates the native Africans. The question of
    > Conrad's racism becomes much more complicated if we understand
    > that the savages of the novel stand in contrast to the object of
    > the book's true condemnation. The honesty of the savages only
    > intensifies Conrad's moral condemnation of his own European
    > culture.

-   Another way of thinking about your conclusion is to try to say what
    further questions your paper raises---what would you like to know
    more about, what puzzle remains---better yet, what *bigger* puzzle
    do you now have?

-   The last thing you might add to your conclusion is a quotation from
    the text that brings your paper to a graceful close. The quotation
    should be striking, gnomic, epigrammatic---a quotation that is
    especially graceful or figurative.

### An effective title: previewing your key concepts 

*After* you've revised the text and, especially, *after* you've
reworked both your introduction and your conclusion, you're ready to
write (or revise) your title. The least useful kind of title is one that
anyone knowing your assignment could predict from the language of the
assignment. If the assignment is, "Discuss the logical structure of the
Declaration of Independence, particularly those assumptions on which
Jefferson based his argument," do not create the title:

The Assumptions behind the Logic\
of The Declaration of Independence

A useful title tells the reader what the central conceptual elements in
your paper are. Those elements are most likely to appear in your
conclusion. So go to your conclusion, particularly to the main point
sentence in your conclusion, and circle six or seven key words,
particularly words that did not appear in the assignment. Now out of
those words, construct a two-part title on the model of

xxxxxxxxx:\
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Something like:

Logic in the Declaration:\
Timeless Ideals and Immediate Realities

The first line ends in a colon, the second line can be longer or shorter
than the first. The reason for writing a two-part title is that if you
don't get it right in the first part, you might get it right in the
second. Avoid using words in your title if those words are not prominent
in your paper. The point of a title is to anticipate key concepts, not
to be clever.

### The last tasks: proofreading and formatting 

Your last task may seem trivial, but for a good many of your teachers,
it will determine whether they judge you to be careful, thoughtful, and
mature writer, or sloppy, careless, and thoughtless: You have to
proofread your paper to be certain that you have no spelling errors,
your grammar is acceptable, the sentences are reasonably punctuated, and
your paper is in the right format.

At least run your spell-checker. (Beware of grammar checkers; all those
we've tested to date \[September, 1998\] have proved unreliable.)
Better yet, put your paper aside for an hour, then return to it to catch
the kinds of errors that spell-checkers can't find: wrong words,
sentence fragments, mish-mashes of sentences and paragraphs that you
created when you were deleting, cutting, and pasting. Do your subjects
and verbs agree? If you are working on a computer, do global searches
for these words to be certain that you are using them correctly: *there,
their, they're; its, it's; your, you're.*

[An update from SamR.  Grammar checkers have gotten much better in the
past twenty years.  But you still should not take everything they say as
accurate or necessary.  If you have questions, consult with one of the
normal cast of characters (writing lab, writing mentors, your professor,
etc.).  The two most common grammar checkers students seem to use are
the Microsoft Word grammar checker and Grammarly.  I even use Grammarly
from time to time as a quick check.

Have your roommate read your paper. It is not dishonest to ask a friend
to read over a paper to catch typos and so on. We all do it.

Before you run off your last draft, make sure of all this:

1.  Pick a standard type font, preferably a "serif" type. (Serif fonts
    like Garamond or Times are easier to read over long stretches than
    sans serif fonts like Helvetica or Ariel.) Unless you're willing to
    bear unpleasant consequences, you shouldn't choose this moment to
    express your creativity using one of the ornate or bizarre fonts on
    your computer. Pick a standard font like Times, Palatino, or
    Garamond.
2.  Use a 12 point font.
3.  Be sure your printer will produce a clear, dark *black* type. Don't
    turn in a paper printed in green, red, blue, etc. Black and only
    black.
4.  Double-space (except for block quotations; single space them).
5.  Margins all the way around of no more than 1.25 inches.
6.  Number your pages in the upper right hand corner. In all forms of
    Microsoft Word, you may learn how to do this by consulting the
    online help on "headers." More recent versions of Word will allow
    you to add page numbers directly from the "Insert" menu.
7.  Put your name at the top of every page. Again, you may use Word's
    "headers" function to do this.
8.  On the first page, in the upper right hand corner, put your name,
    the date, your class number and section (if any), and the name of
    your instructor:
9.  After you print it out, staple the pages together.
10. **Be sure that you have made two copies of your paper, and that you
    have backed up your file on a separate floppy, optical disk, or zip
    disk.** [SamR Says: You no longer use external disks.  But if
    you've been working in a lab computer, make sure that your file
    is backed up to the cloud and, perhaps, a flash drive.]

> ------------------------------------------------------------------------

So! Now your task is done. Or maybe not: for most writers, the process
isn't always a uniformly smooth and happy one. If you get blocked, or
if you get stuck, you may be afraid you'll have no pages to number;
perfect formatting is pointless when there's nothing there to format.
In our next section, therefore, we warn against one bad way to get out
of blocks and suggest one good way to help the writing process move
along. Go to "[But what if you get stuck?](writing-in-college-05.html)"
