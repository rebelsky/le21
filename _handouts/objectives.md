Students in the Tutorial develop college-level academic skills through their encounter with an intellectual question posed by the topic of the course. The course readings, assignments, discussions, and exercises should help students not only develop these skills but also deepen their understanding of the Tutorial’s subject matter. By the end of the Tutorial, students should be able to describe key issues or questions raised by critical, focused examination of the Tutorial topic.
    
1. Tutorial has been designated a writing-intensive course that **introduces students to college-level writing**. By the end of the Tutorial, students should be able to

    a. Employ a deliberate and iterative writing process that includes brainstorming, planning, gathering evidence, drafting, and revising

    b. Make appropriate stylistic and rhetorical choices with regard to audience, purpose, and context for each piece of writing

    c. Situate their own ideas within a critical conversation about a particular topic

    d. Revise a draft in response to specific feedback provided by their classmates, a peer writing mentor, and/or their instructor

    e. Use appropriate conventions for quoting and citing primary and secondary sources
    
2. Tutorial helps students develop **critical reading** skills through close reading of texts and analysis of materials. By the end of the Tutorial, students should be able to
 
    a. Describe the form and function of different kinds of texts (which may include a film, image, poem, data set, etc.)
 
    b. Identify the audience, purpose, and issues at stake in different kinds of texts
 
    c. Understand how scholarly writing differs from popular writing and the conventions appropriate to their audience, purpose, and medium
 
    d. Identify how a work of scholarship participates in an ongoing conversation about a particular topic
 
    e. Assess the credibility of a text in terms of its methodology, evidence, reasoning, and sources
    
3. Tutorial introduces students to college-level **oral communication skills** through class discussion and/or prepared presentations. By the end of the Tutorial, students should be able to
 
    a. Prepare comments and questions about readings or other assignments
 
    b. Contribute to a discussion by responding directly to questions or statements from the instructor or their classmates
 
    c. Deliver a prepared presentation with structure and content appropriate to the assignment and audience
 
    d. Engage diversity and disagreement in ways that acknowledge dissonance and conflict respectfully.
    
4. The tutorial initially **acquaints students with a librarian and library resources**. By the end of Tutorial, students should be able to:
 
    a. Read, interpret and use citations to access materials (find full text, find in library, request via Interlibrary Loan).
 
    b. Employ different research tools, such as the library catalog, library databases, and web search engines, based on an understanding of the different resources they offer.
 
    c. Recognize that there are different information source types that will be appropriate for different academic purposes. For example: background/reference source, critical literature/secondary source, archival/primary source.
 
    d. Select sources based on critical evaluation of the appropriateness, relevance, and timeliness of the information found to strategically explore a question in the context of their academic work.
 
    e. Articulate how a particular source or source type could be used in the course of academic writing or a particular writing assignment.
    
5. Tutorial introduces students to **academic honesty policies and practices** at Grinnell, including both correct citation practices and discussion of issues related to academic integrity. By the end of the Tutorial, students should be able to
 
    a. Define academic integrity and articulate its importance in scholarly work
 
    b. Identify specific behaviors that constitute academic dishonesty, including but not limited to cheating on tests; turning in written or graphic work without citing correctly the sources of ideas, words, data, or images; collaborating with others on projects and homework where that is not allowed; and other behaviors described in the College’s handbook, Academic Honesty: Scholarly Integrity, Collaboration, and the Ethical Use of Sources.
 
    c. Understand the procedures that would be initiated if suspected of academic dishonesty and the potential outcomes for violating the policy
 
    d. Demonstrate basic ability to incorporate other people’s words and ideas into their own writing by paraphrasing, summarizing, quoting (block quotes and snippets), and responding to an idea or argument.
 
    e. Correctly utilize at least one type of citation method and format.
    
6. The tutorial instructor serves as **academic adviser** to the tutees to help them plan individualized academic programs in the liberal arts. By the end of the Tutorial, students should be able to
 
    a. Understand the [C]ollege’s liberal arts philosophy and select courses that reflect the breadth of this educational experience
 
    b. Locate academic policies in the Student Handbook (e.g., the academic requirements for graduation) and academic procedures on the Registrar’s GrinnellShare site (e.g. how to drop or add a course)
 
    c. Use the Academic Catalog, the Schedule of Courses, and Student Planning to explore the curriculum and develop a course schedule
 
    d. Demonstrate accurate knowledge of course sequences within a department, including the definition of the term “pre-requisite”, and write a (very tentative) four-year plan
 
    e. Monitor academic progress using the online resources such as Student Planning
 
    f. Identify resources that can provide assistance when facing academic difficulty in a particular subject

7. By the end of this course, students will be able to (a) productively **discuss structures and goals of liberal education** that draw upon a wide range of sources and (b) **apply this knowledge to the shaping of their own liberal education**.  To achieve these goals, students must not only be able to draw upon a variety of perspectives and sources, but also have formed their own, appropriately supported views on liberal education.  For example, students must be able to

    a. Describe at least three models of liberal arts education, including both Grinnell's "The Six Elements of a Liberal Arts Education at Grinnell" and a more holisitic model, such as the one William Cronon details in "Only Connect".
 
    b. Describe four key aspects of a Grinnell education---Tutorial, the Open Curriculum, Self-Governance, and Scholars' Convocation---and explain how they (might) contribute to liberal education.
 
    c. Suggest ways in which liberal education might (need to) change to adapt to America and the world in the 21st century.
 
    d. Articulate and defend a personal vision of liberal education.
 
    e. Draft a four-year plan based on that personal vision.
