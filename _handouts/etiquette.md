## Preliminary Dialogue

I'm an adult. Many of the suggestions below seem obvious. Do you really think that I don't know how to behave?
 :  I would like to believe that you know how to behave and, in my
    experience, many students do know how to behave appropriately in
    many contexts. However, I also know that academe has different
    expectations and experience tells me that not all students succeed
    at meeting those expectations.

Don't I have the right to behave as I wish?
 :  You can behave as you wish, provided you consider the consquences.
    Self-governance suggests that you must consider the effects of your
    actions on others. As importantly, the way you behave affects the
    assumptions that others make about you.

You clearly don't follow all of these guidelines. Why should we behave differently than you do?
  : It is likely the case that there are times that I could behave
    better. However, I have a different status than you do. Power
    structures suggest that I can do things that you cannot. I also have
    different responsibilities. For example, I keep my cell phone on
    because I may need to handle an emergency with my children.

Do you really care about all of these guidelines?
  : As your experience will soon tell you, I do not care whether or not
    you follow many of these guidelines when you meet with me. However,
    I do know that many of my colleagues do care about these things, and
    you certainly present a better "face" to people if you follow them.

## Everywhere

*Avoid the use of profanity.* As a society, we tend to use profanity in
a wide variety of situations. However, the use of profanity can offend
others. Please avoid it in the classroom, and elsewhere if possible.
Note that I do my best to avoid swearing in front of my students. This
avoidance has enhanced the impact of profanity the few times I've used
it. (A student even noted "I knew you were seriously affected by the
event because you swore, and you never swear.") 

*Address people with
their title and last name.* Unless told otherwise, you should refer to
your professors as "Professor *Name*". There are a variety of reasons to
use the title of "Professor", not least that it reflects upon the
achievements and authority your professors possess. You will find that
some professors allow you to address them in other ways, or even insist
upon it. For example, I prefer to have you call me "Sam". Nonetheless,
your first assumption should always be that people prefer to be
addressed with title and last name. 

*Pay attention to your physical
state.* Amidst the chaos and stress of college life, some students start
to let themselves go a bit. Please take the time to shower, brush your
teeth, and change clothes. These things may not make much difference to
you, but they do affect the people around you.

## In the classroom

The classroom is a special place, and deserves special behavior. You've
probably identified some aspects of special behavior during your
pre-college time. However, some expectations are different in college.

*Show up on time.* Coming to class late disrupts the class and
negatively affects those around you. Coming to class late also tells the
teacher that you are not serious about the class. If you must come to
class late, enter as unobtrusively as you can. 

*If you must use the restroom during class, leave and return without
disruption.* You may be accustomed to asking permission to leave
the room. In general, we expect that you are adults and can determine
when it is necessary for you to leave the room. Note, however, that
you should strive to use the restroom and to take care of other
business before or after class, not during.

*Turn off your cell phone.* Phones ringing during class are a
distraction. Be respectful of your colleagues and your teacher. 

*Don't text.* Your attention should be on the class, not on your
phone.  Remember, as one of my colleagues says, "Students may not
think that we see them in class, but we do, even in large lecture
classes."

*Don't dominate discussions.* You may find that you often have
things to contribute to discussions, and that's great. However, you
should make sure that your colleagues have the opportunity to speak.
You may even learn something from them. You also should give them
the opportunity to benefit from the learning that comes from
participating.

*Participate in discussions.* I firmly belive that everyone has
something to contribute.  If you do not participate, you rob your
colleagues of a valuable perspective. As one of my colleagues writes,

> \[A\] tutorial/seminar is a social event\[.\] \[I\]f someone comes to
> a social event and never says a thing, it is inconsiderate and
> eventually rude. So they need to say something even if it's just: "I
> appreciated what X said because of Y." By the same token, if someone
> comes to a social event, and never shuts up, that is also
> inconsiderate and eventually rude.

## In electronic mail

There are clear generational differences in how people approach
electronic mail. There are also personal differences. When emailing
friends, you can be casual. When emailing faculty and staff, you should
treat email as professional communication. In particular, 

*Use correct grammar, spelling, and capitalization.* Casual writing
in email suggests to many readers that you do not take them (or the
subject of the message) seriously.

*Take the time to write an appropriate subject.*
Your reader should be able to tell at a glance what your email is about.
Those who receive hundreds of email messages each day rely on subjects
to prioritize and organize. Choosing no subject or an incorrect subject
may lead your message to be deprioritized or to make your recipient
think that you have not taken the message seriously.

## When meeting with faculty members

As you will soon discover, faculty members are generally happy to meet
with their students. At the same time, faculty members have limited
time, and you should strive to make the best use of your time that you
can. As one of my colleagues writes,

> Stop before you knock: Remove outerwear; throw out coffee cup or
> lunch; get out whatever notes or paper you want to discuss. After
> greeting the professor, wait to be invited in and remain standing
> until asked to sit down. Then attend to business. Watch the time. If
> the professor stands up, the student should stand too, and prepare to
> leave, unless invited to stay further.

## When requesting letters or recommendation

At some point in your career, you will be likely to need letters of
recommendation from some of your faculty. You may need letters for
internships, for jobs, for graduate applications, for scholarships, for
something that advances your life. In most cases, you will find your
faculty are willing to write letters. Still, you help ensure the best
possible letters by being polite in how you approach the task. I realize
that this advice comes a bit early in your career. Nonetheless, this
seems like a convenient place to put this advice. I also know, from
talking to my colleagues, that they value students who are respectful in
requesting letters. 

*Ask, don't demand.* This advice seems obvious.  Nonetheless, I've
seen a variety of students simply plop forms on someone's desk (or
have the forms sent via email) without asking first.  Faculty are
not required to write your letters, so be polite in requesting them.

*Ask not "Will you write me a letter?" but rather "Will you write
me a positive letter?"* You might think that people asked to write
a recommendation letter who would not write a favorable letter would
refuse, but I had at least one colleague at a previous instiution
who said (approximately), "Letters will reflect their work and
behavior in my class. Hence, students should know when I am unlikley
to write a favorable letter.".

*Give as much advance notice as possible.* While it does not take
a huge amount of time to write a letter (I can usually write one
in about one or two hours, and it takes about fifteen minutes per
place for custom forms), many of us have very little free time, and
are likely to write better letters if we have some time to reflect.

*Make sure to fill out and sign any forms.* Again, this should be
self-evident. Nonetheless, I'd say at least 25% of the forms I receive
still require a signature or other information from the student. 

*Provide a [FERPA release](https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/documents/FERPA%20Authorization%20for%20Reference%20or%20Recommendation.pdf).*  FERPA dictates that we should not release information about you without you
permission.  While the request to write letters provide implicit permission,
it helps to have explicit permission.

*Offer to provide addressed envelopes.* Otherwise we (or the support
staff) will need to take the time to address the envelopes.
