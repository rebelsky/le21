# {{ page.title }}

Because the 50th anniversary of Tutorial and the Open Curriculum is
fast approaching, I have decided to take advantage of our Tutorial
to have us create an anthology related to that topic.  Admittedly, I 
have students in all my Tutorials create anthologies; this one just
has a more significant context.

Each student in the course will become an expert in one area related
to the broad topic of Tutorial and will write one chapter of the
anthology.  In addition, students will create and gather other
resources for the anthology, such as interviews with alumni, faculty,
staff, students, and administrators.  We will also look for other
materials to include.

At the end of the semester, the members of the Tutorial will organize
the materials, write an introduction, and design a book cover.  We
will then create an electronic book and, hopefully, a printed book,
which we will distribute to the members of Tutorial, others on
campus, and the College archives.  President Harris has expressed
particular interest in seeing our anthology.

While I would prefer that all students include their work in the
anthology, you may choose to exclude your work.

For those interested in going beyond what we produce, I hope to
create an extended version of our antholody in preparation for
next year's anniversary.
