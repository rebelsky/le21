Over the past few weeks you have developed expertise in some topic related
to liberal education.  You've gathered information on the topic, led a
discussion, formed a claim or claims about the topic, wrote an introduction
to a longer paper, and outlined that longer paper.  Now it's time to bring
your work to fruition and take the ultimate step and write the
paper.  Or perhaps it's time to take the penultimate step and write
a good draft of the paper.  After all, by this time we know that
we benefit from multiple drafts.

**The Assignment**: Write a moderate-length (3000-4000 word)
argumentative paper on the topic you have chosen. As is the case
with any good argumentative paper, your paper should have a central
point and provide a wealth of supporting evidence for that point.
In supporting your point, you should draw upon the sources that you
have identified in prior assignments and upon other sources you
have discovered. You may also want to reflect upon the reactions
and comments of your colleagues during the discussion of the topic.

**Using this work**: You will present your work to the class in a
number of ways. First, you will distribute your essay to your classmates
for peer editing.  We will do that peer editing during the second
half of week 6.  Second, you will give a presentation about the topic
during the first half of week 6.  Your presentation may follow your
paper carefully or you may find it useful to deviate from the form
of the essay.  Finally, you will revise the paper and turn it in at
the beginning of week 7.  You and your colleagues will then use it for
our final writing assignment---an introduction to the anthology of
papers.

Further information about the presentations will be available in the
near future.  Expect to have about fifteen minutes to present and
an additional ten minutes for questions and answers.

**_About the term "Draft"_**.  Although this assignment is designated
as a draft, it should be a substantial draft. That is, it should
contain grammatical sentences, a logical flow of reasoning, and a
substantial point. You should have had at least one other person
read and comment on it.  A weak draft will give your colleagues
little opportunity to suggest interesting improvements, so the
quality of your final paper will depend substantially on the quality
of this draft.
