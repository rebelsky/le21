**Background**: As I noted, this semester we will be looking both 
back and looking ahead.  We look back to look at prior models
of liberal education and Grinnell's specific approaches to liberal
education (embodied by the open curriculum, Tutorial, Scholars'
Convocation, and Tutorial).  We look ahead to what a liberal education
might ential in the 21st century, particularly given the events of
the past year.

While there are articles about these issues, we also gain some insight 
by talking to others.  These conversations will deepen our understanding,
provide personal perspectives, and perhaps even open new avenues of
exploration.  They will also potentially provide us with additional
elements to include in [our anthology](../handouts/anthology).

**The basics**: Pick two people associated with Grinnell to interview.
(See the list below.)  You will discuss the particulars of Grinnell's
education with one and the future of liberal education with another.
Each conversation should take approximately thirty minutes and you
will record/transcribe the conversation using
[Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/login).  Afterwards, you will choose a
portion of each conversation (approximately 250-500 words) that you
think will be of value to others, "clean up" that portion, and add a
short introduction describing the interviewee.  

**Audience**: Your audience is readers of our anthology about Liberal
Education in the 21st century and the role of Grinnell's approach to
that kind of education.  Think of them as folks who might attend a
seminar about those issues and would appreciate a book to prepare or
follow up.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following 
Tutorial objectives.

* 3a\. Prepare comments and questions about readings or other assignments.  (_Your comments and questions for the interviewees will be based on past readings._)
* 3b\. Contribute to a discussion by responding directly to questions or statements from the instructor or their classmates. (_Your interviewees are not classmates, but we are building similar skills_.)
* 4c\. Recognize that there are different information source types that will be appropriate for different academic purposes. For example: background/reference source, critical literature/secondary source, archival/primary source.  (_We are building archival/primary sources._)
* 7b\. Describe four key aspects of a Grinnell education—Tutorial, the Open Curriculum, Self-Governance, and Scholars’ Convocation—and explain how they (might) contribute to liberal education.
* 7c\. Suggest ways in which liberal education might (need to) change to adapt to America and the world in the 21st century.

In addition, this assignment relates to at least two of William Cronon's goals
for liberal education.

* 1\. They listen and they hear.
* 3\. They can talk with anyone.

Finally, this activity will give you experience writing a very different
kind of text and in thinking about details of sentence construction.

**Preparatory process**

We will spend class time on the following.

1. Considering how to approach the interview process.

2. Developing a set of basic questions for each type of interview.

3. Matching students with interview subjects.

4. Drafting email to request interviews.

5. Signing up for and practicing with Otter.ai.

**Primary process**

As always, you should begin by reviewing the process, determining
when you will do each step in the process, considering when you
can use help on the process, and arranging meetings with your 
writing mentors.

1. Send email to your two interviewees to schedule meetings.

2. Gather whatever information you think will be relevant
to each interview, such as background on the person you are interviewing
or information on a time period at Grinnell.

3. Conduct each interview.  Make sure to (a) confirm with the interviewee
that they are comfortable having the interview recorded and (b) start
Otter.ai to record and transcribe the interview.  If possible, you
should also (c) take notes during the interview.

4. Review your notes and transcript from each interview.

5. Identify what part of each interview you think would be most useful
to report to others.  (Approximately 500 words per interview.)

6. Determine whether you need any additional information and obtain
that information.

7. Convert the selected portion of each transcript to standard English
without disturbing the overall meaning or approximate sentence structure
of your interviewee.  (You can, however, write new questions to go with
the material you are using, providing they do not mislead the reader
about the interviewee's meaning.)

8. Write a short (approximately four or five sentences) introduction
to each interview that provides background about the interviewee and
gives a hint about the content of the interview.  For example,

    > Sam Rebelsky is a Professor of Computer Science at Grinnell
    College.  While you might not expect a computer scientist to
    think much about liberal education, Prof. Rebelsky regularly
    blogs about these issues and clearly has strong opinions on the
    matter.  In our interview, Rebelsky drew upon his twenty-plus
    years at Grinnell and his own experience at the University of
    Chicago to expound on the value of Scholars Convocation as a
    mechanism for providing a necessary shared background for
    Grinnell students.

    or

    > Sam Rebelsky is a Professor of Computer Science at Grinnell
    College.  This semester, Prof. Rebelsky is running a Tutorial
    on Grinnell Education and Liberal Education in the 21st 
    Century.  In our interview, Rebelsky raised a number of
    potential components of liberal education, including more
    explicit requirements for cultural competence, modes of
    communication that go beyond speaking or writing, and the ability
    to read charts, his most valuable and challenging suggestion
    was that all liberally educated students should be able to
    interpret and create LOLcats.  If that surprises you, read on.

9. Email me your two interviews with introductions.

**Primary post-processing**

1. We will all read these interviews and consider how we might
incorporate them in our larger research projects.

2. At the end of the semester, you will decide how these interviews
will fit into our edited anthology.

**Some potential interview subjects**

Our communal goals in choosing interview subjects are (a) to obtain
a variety of perspectives on these issues, (b) to understand the
roles of Tutorial, the open curriculum, Scholars Convocation, and
self governance across the past fifty years, and (c) to gather some
new and unexpected suggestions for the future of liberal education.

I've identified a variety of people on campus who are likely to
provide you with a valuable perspective.  You might also suggest
others.  (The list is woefully incomplete; these are the ones that
came to mind as I reflect on people and the topics you have raised.)
Note that I am still in the process of confirming that these folks
are willing to be interviewed.

Jon Andelson '70
  : Andelson is both an alum and a faculty member.  As someone who
    was a student at Grinnell when the Tutorial and open curriculum
    were first created and as a faculty member soon after their creation,
    Andelson will have a unique perspective on how Grinnell education has
    evolved over the past fifty years.  Andelson also served as director
    of the College's Center for Prairie studies and is likely to 
    have strong opinions on how our location shapes and might shape
    a Grinnell edcation.

Tim Arner
  : Arner is a faculty member in English and is currently serving
    as an Associate Dean.  As Associate Dean, Arner has taken the
    lead in developing Tutorial.

George Drake '56
  : Drake is Professor Emeritus of History and former President of
    Grinnell.  He was also Dean at Colorado at about the time the
    block plan was introduced.  Drake instituted Scholars' Convocation 
    in his time as Grinnell President.  As a person on campus with 
    knowledge about Grinnell across multiple decades and as someone
    who has steered the College, Drake will likely have valuable
    insights about Grinnell education and the future of liberal
    education.

David Feldman '70
  : Feldman graduated in 1970 with Grinnell's first independent
    major.  He is an active alumnus and is also the author of
    the "Imponderables" series of books.  He could be a good
    resource on the state of Grinnell at the time Tutorial and
    the open curriculum were created.  And, as someone who studies
    a wide variety of topics, he may also have useful opinions
    on the future of liberal education.

Jen Jacobsen '95
  : As a student, Jacobsen worked with historian Al Jones on
    _Pioneering_, a history of Grinnell.  Jacobsen also served
    as the College's Student Wellness coordinator for a number
    of years and is now assessing the new First Year Experience
    course.  I learn something from Jen each time we talk, and
    I expect she'd have thoughtful things to say about the past
    and the future.

Chris Jones
  : Jones serves as the College's archivist.  In that role, he is 
    likely to know of a variety of (potentially surprising) aspects 
    of the College's modes of education.

Katya Gibel Mevorach
  : Gibel Mevorach is Professor of Anthropology and a long-serving
    member of the Grinnell faculty.  As a faculty member, Gibel
    Mevorach has been outspoken about many aspects of Grinnell's
    curriculum (and has helped shape my own opinion about that
    curriculum).  I do not know what she would say about the past
    our the future, but I expect it will be an exciting interview.

Kim Gilbert '82
  : Gilbert is a member of the library staff and an alum from the
    early 1980's.  As an alum and a long-serving staff member, Gilbert
    is likely to have unique perspectives on the different aspects
    of Grinnell education.

Andy Hamilton '85
  : Hamilton is the Director of Athletics and Recreation and a
    graduate of the class of 1985.  As we look back, Hamilton 
    will likely be able to reflect on changes in Grinnell education 
    over the past forty or so years.  As we look ahead, Hamilton
    is likely to provide insights based on his experience and his
    roles.

Anne Harris
  : Harris is President of Grinnell College.  It is clear that 
    Harris' vision is one of the reasons chose her to lead Grinnell.
    Harris might also be useful in providing an outsider's view
    of the primary components of a Grinnell education.

David Lopatto
  : Lopatto is Professor of Psychology, Samuel R. and Marie-Louise
    Rosenthal Professor of Natural Science, and the Director of
    Grinnell's Center for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment.  Lopatto's
    long experience at Grinnell and his work directing the Center suggest
    that he will have unique insights on Grinnell's past and on 
    modern liberal education.

Elaine Marluff
  : Marzluff is Acting Dean of Grinnell College and Breid-Mcfarland 
    Professor of Science.  As Dean, Marzluff is responsible for the
    academic program at Grinnell.  Marzluff also has more than
    twenty years of experience teaching at Grinnell.

Celeste Miller
  : Miller is Associate Professor of Theatre and Dance and is our
    lead faculty member in Dance.  In that role, Miller is likely
    to have a somewhat different perspective on liberal education,
    perhaps including the (understated) roles of the arts and of
    non-textual communication in modern liberal education.

Wayne Moyer
  : Moyers is one of Grinnell's longest-serving faculty members, having
    started her as an instructor in 1972.  He's is also former
    director of the College's Rosenfield program.  Moyer is likely
    to provide thoughtful and useful reflections on nearly five
    decades of Tutorial at Grinnell.  His expertise in public affairs
    and international relations will likely lead to some great
    insights on liberal education in a time of globalization and
    complex politics.

Nino Parker '07
  : Parker is Senior Associate Director of Alumni and Donor
    Relations and a graduate from this century.  (I mention
    that, in part, because I've included a lot of graduates
    from the prior century in my list.)  Parker can provide
    insight into how alums view Grinnell and Grinnell education,
    helping us look both backward and ahead.  Parker's insights
    about his own time at Grinnell are also likely to serve
    us well.

Sarah J. Purcell '92
  : Purcell is L F Parker Professor of History and an alumna of
    Grinnell.  Purcell has served a wide variety of roles, including
    College Parliamentarian and Director of the Rosenfield program.
    Purcell has also been a leader in looking at new directions in
    education, incorporating virtual reality in her research and
    spearheading the College's Digital Liberal Arts program.

Henry Rietz '89
  : Rietz is Professor of Religious Studies.  For our purposes,
    it is equally important that Rietz is an alumnus and regularly
    teaches Tutorials related to Grinnell (its history, the identity
    of Grinnellians, etc.).  As Religion and Religious Studies have
    played a variety of roles in the history of lieral education,
    Rietz is likely to provide some insight as the to roles they
    might play in the future.

Fredo Rivera '06
  : Rivera is a member of the Art History faculty and an alumnus
    fro the class of 2006.  In my experiences with Fredo (primarily
    as a faculty member), I have found him deeply thoughtful 
    about many things.  I expect he can speak well to the successes
    and flaws of Grinnell education in his years as a student at
    Grinnell as well as suggest ways Grinnell education (and all
    liberal education) might evolve.

Schvalla Rivera
  : Rivera is the College's Chief Diversity Officer.  Particularly
    as we see increasing need for students (and all citizens) to have
    deeper understanding of diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
    anti-racism, she can provide valuable insights on how a liberal
    education for the future can best incorporate these areas.

Vickie Rutherford
  : Rutherford is Assistant Registrar and has served in the Registrar's
    office for multiple decades.  As Assistant Registrar, she's seen
    changes in requirements and policies, considered the kinds of
    schedules students put together, and more.  Rutherford is likely
    to provide us with very different kinds of insights.

Maure Smith-Benanti
  : Smith-Benanti is the College's Dean for Diversity, Equity, and 
    Inclusion.  In that role, she regularly reflects on the ways
    Grinnell's modes of education do and do not serve important
    roles.  Smith-Benanti is also a key lead in the design and
    implementation of the new First-Year Experience course, a
    course that is likely to become the fifth component of a
    Grinell education.

Joyce Stern '91
  : Stern serves as Dean for Student Success and Academic Advising.
    In that role, Stern has primary responsibility for Tutorial.
    As Dean for Student Success, Stern can also provide insight on
    skills that will likely be useful for the future.  As an alum,
    Stern can reflect back on the various components of Grinnell
    education and how they and their roles have changed in the past
    thirty years.

John David Stone
  : Stone is Senior Lecturer in Computer Science.  He has been
    at the College since the mid 1980's.  Stone has strong opinions
    on Grinnell education, particularly what he describes as the
    need for the College to train "gadflies".

Susan Sanning
  : Sanning is Associate Dean & Director of Service & Social Innovation
    in the Center for Careers, Life, and Service (CLS).  Sanning has
    deep insights on the roles of community service (in more) in 
    education and reflects regularly on the relationship between
    college education and post-graduate outcomes.

Tisha Turk
  : Turk runs Grinnell's Center for Writing, Reading, and Speaking
    and is likely to have valuable views on Tutorial (looking back)
    and on academic skills for the future (looking ahead).

Carle VanWilligen
  : VanWilligen is Director of Institutional Research at Grinnell.
    In that role, she has done more with data about Grinnell than
    almost anyone else I know.  I do not know what insights she
    can (or is allowed to) share, but I do know that I always find
    her insightful.

**Q&A**

Can I just interview my professor or coach?
  : If you believe that your professor or coach would provide us with
    valuable information on Grinnell education or the future of
    liberal education, you may ask them to be one of your two
    interviewees.  However, you must also reach out to someone you
    do not know.  It's good practice!

Can I interview the same person for both purposes?
  : No.  While we may have two interviews with the same person (after
    all, most of these people can provide us with valuable insight
    about both Grinnell practices and the future of liberal education),
    I would like you to have the experience of talking to more than
    one person.

Will you include the template email messages in this assignment?
  : Yes, I will add them at the end once we have written them together.
