**Background**: As I noted, this semester we will be looking both 
back and looking ahead.  We look back to look at prior models
of liberal education and Grinnell's specific approaches to liberal
education (embodied by the open curriculum, Tutorial, Scholars'
Convocation, and Tutorial).  We look ahead to what a liberal education
might ential in the 21st century, particularly given the events of
the past year.

While there are articles about these issues, we also gain some insight 
by talking to others.  These conversations will deepen our understanding,
provide personal perspectives, and perhaps even open new avenues of
exploration.  They will also potentially provide us with additional
elements to include in [our anthology](../handouts/anthology).

**The basics**: Pick two people associated with Grinnell to interview.
(See the list below.)  You will discuss the particulars of Grinnell's
education with one and the future of liberal education with another.
Each conversation should take approximately thirty minutes and you
will record/transcribe the conversation using
[Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/login).  Afterwards, you will choose a
portion of each conversation (approximately 250-500 words) that you
think will be of value to others, "clean up" that portion, and add a
short introduction describing the interviewee.  

**Audience**: Your audience is readers of our anthology about Liberal
Education in the 21st century and the role of Grinnell's approach to
that kind of education.  Think of them as folks who might attend a
seminar about those issues and would appreciate a book to prepare or
follow up.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following 
Tutorial objectives.

* 3a\. Prepare comments and questions about readings or other assignments.  (_Your comments and questions for the interviewees will be based on past readings._)
* 3b\. Contribute to a discussion by responding directly to questions or statements from the instructor or their classmates. (_Your interviewees are not classmates, but we are building similar skills_.)
* 4c\. Recognize that there are different information source types that will be appropriate for different academic purposes. For example: background/reference source, critical literature/secondary source, archival/primary source.  (_We are building archival/primary sources._)
* 7b\. Describe four key aspects of a Grinnell education—Tutorial, the Open Curriculum, Self-Governance, and Scholars’ Convocation—and explain how they (might) contribute to liberal education.
* 7c\. Suggest ways in which liberal education might (need to) change to adapt to America and the world in the 21st century.

In addition, this assignment relates to at least two of William Cronon's goals
for liberal education.

* 1\. They listen and they hear.
* 3\. They can talk with anyone.

Finally, this activity will give you experience writing a very different
kind of text and in thinking about details of sentence construction.

**Preparatory process**

We will spend class time on the following.

1. Considering how to approach the interview process.

2. Developing a set of basic questions for each type of interview.

3. Matching students with interview subjects.

4. Drafting email to request interviews.

5. Signing up for and practicing with Otter.ai.

**Primary process**

As always, you should begin by reviewing the process, determining
when you will do each step in the process, considering when you
can use help on the process, and arranging meetings with your 
writing mentors.

1. Send email to your two interviewees to schedule meetings.

2. Gather whatever information you think will be relevant
to each interview, such as background on the person you are interviewing
or information on a time period at Grinnell.

3. Conduct each interview.  Make sure to (a) confirm with the interviewee
that they are comfortable having the interview recorded and (b) start
Otter.ai to record and transcribe the interview.  If possible, you
should also (c) take notes during the interview.

4. Review your notes and transcript from each interview.

5. Identify what part of each interview you think would be most useful
to report to others.  (Approximately 500 words per interview.)

6. Determine whether you need any additional information and obtain
that information.

7. Convert the selected portion of each transcript to standard English
without disturbing the overall meaning or approximate sentence structure
of your interviewee.  (You can, however, write new questions to go with
the material you are using, providing they do not mislead the reader
about the interviewee's meaning.)

8. Write a short (approximately four or five sentences) introduction
to each interview that provides background about the interviewee and
gives a hint about the content of the interview.  For example,

    > Sam Rebelsky is a Professor of Computer Science at Grinnell
    College.  While you might not expect a computer scientist to
    think much about liberal education, Prof. Rebelsky regularly
    blogs about these issues and clearly has strong opinions on the
    matter.  In our interview, Rebelsky drew upon his twenty-plus
    years at Grinnell and his own experience at the University of
    Chicago to expound on the value of Scholars Convocation as a
    mechanism for providing a necessary shared background for
    Grinnell students.

    or

    > Sam Rebelsky is a Professor of Computer Science at Grinnell
    College.  This semester, Prof. Rebelsky is running a Tutorial
    on Grinnell Education and Liberal Education in the 21st 
    Century.  In our interview, Rebelsky raised a number of
    potential components of liberal education, including more
    explicit requirements for cultural competence, modes of
    communication that go beyond speaking or writing, and the ability
    to read charts, his most valuable and challenging suggestion
    was that all liberally educated students should be able to
    interpret and create LOLcats.  If that surprises you, read on.

9. Email me your two interviews with introductions.

**Primary post-processing**

1. We will all read these interviews and consider how we might
incorporate them in our larger research projects.

2. At the end of the semester, you will decide how these interviews
will fit into our edited anthology.

**Some potential interview subjects**

Our communal goals in choosing interview subjects are (a) to obtain
a variety of perspectives on these issues, (b) to understand the
roles of Tutorial, the open curriculum, Scholars Convocation, and
self governance across the past fifty years, and (c) to gather some
new and unexpected suggestions for the future of liberal education.

I will provide you with a separate list of potential interview subjects.

**Q&A**

Can I just interview my professor or coach?
  : If you believe that your professor or coach would provide us with
    valuable information on Grinnell education or the future of
    liberal education, you may ask them to be one of your two
    interviewees.  However, you must also reach out to someone you
    do not know.  It's good practice!

Can I interview the same person for both purposes?
  : No.  While we may have two interviews with the same person (after
    all, most of these people can provide us with valuable insight
    about both Grinnell practices and the future of liberal education),
    I would like you to have the experience of talking to more than
    one person.

Will you include the template email messages in this assignment?
  : Yes, I will add them at the end once we have written them together.
