title: Miscellaneous Assignment 10
subtitle: Organizing the anthology
summary: | 
  For this assignment, you will provide me 
  with a table of contents for our class anthology and
  an explanation as to why you have organized the material that way.
audience: |
  Like your essays, your organization is intended for a general
  audience, one that has some understanding of American Higher
  education and is interested in learning a bit more.  If you prefer,
  you might decide that your audience is primarily Grinnellians
  (alumni, students, staff and faculty, prospective students and
  parents).
purpose: |
  The primary purpose of this assignment is to get you to reflect
  on the work we've done and how it interrelates.  I hope it
  encourages you to revisit your colleagues' work and to think about
  its relationship to the overall Tutorial theme.  
collaboration: |
  Each student should submit their own responses to this assignment.
  You may consult other students in the class as you review the
  course materials. If you receive help from anyone, make sure to
  cite them in your responses.
submitting: |
  Please email your work to me before class.

We will be assembling all of the papers from this
class into an anthology of sorts.   That anthology will need to
present the material in an order.  You are responsible for choosing
the order and explaining why you chose that order.

**_The Table of Contents_**

As you've likely realized by now, the ordering of materials in an
anthology are rarely haphazard.  An editor (or group of editors)
has explored appropriate orders to present the material, considering
how the different parts might support or challenge each other.  In
many cases, they have also grouped them into larger sections.

Your goal in creating the table of contents is to do much the same.
Among other things, you might consider what "story" you are telling
with the materials and what you think the focus of our anthology
should be.  You may also want to reflect on what to do with ancillary
materials; should they be grouped together, perhaps as appendices,
or do you add interest by interspersing them amongst the essays?

Your table of contents should be in outline form and include all
of the following materials.

* The longer essays you and your peers wrote.
* Your early essays about new components to the liberal arts.  (I
  will not require you to include these essays in the anthology.  However,
  for the purposes of this assignment you should assume we've decided
  to include them.)
* Beryl Clotfelter's essay on the origins of the open curriculum
  (Let's assume I can get permission to include it.)
* Our interview summaries.
* Any other materials you consider it relevant to include in the anthology.

You should not include page numbers as those will depend on a variety
of factors.  Your primary goals are ordering and grouping.

**_Explaining the Table of Contents_**

Ideally, you have spent some time considering the appropriate
ordering and grouping of materials for the table of contents.  Those
writing introductions have likely explained your choice of ordering
in the introduction.  Those of you creating book covers have not
had the opportunity to do so.  Hence, I would like you to write a
short (approximately one page, single-spaced) explanation of your
table of contents.  This explanation is not intended for publication,
so it should require a bit less attention than you might otherwise
give.  However, I do expect correct grammar and logical flow of
ideas.  Ideally, you have made Williams' principles a habit, and
those will appear naturally in your writing.

**What to turn in**:

* (i) A table of contents and
* (ii) a short explanation of why you have ordered the contents in the way you did.
