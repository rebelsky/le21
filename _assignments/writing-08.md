We're getting close to the end.  You've spent a lot of time on your topic.
You've written a smooth draft of an extended essay on the topic.  You've
also presented on the topic.  Often, looking at your material in these
two different forms helps you rethink your approach.  Now's the time to
do so!

We will be assembling all of the papers from this class into an anthology.
If all goes well, copies of the anthology will be printed and made available
for the 50th anniversary of the open curriculum.

You would, of course, like to use this opportunity to give others a
strong impression of not only your topic but also of you as thinker
and writer.  Take your draft and make it shine.

**The Assignment**: Starting with your earlier draft, write a
moderate-length (3000-4000 word) argumentative paper on the topic
you have chosen. As is the case with any good argumentative paper,
your paper should have a central point and provide a wealth of
supporting evidence for that point.  In supporting your point, you
should draw upon the sources that you have identified in prior
assignments and upon other sources you have discovered. 

You should, of course, draw upon the comments you received on your
draft and you presentation as you reshape this paper.

**_Warning!_** It is quite likely that this paper will be distributed to
people outside the Tutorial.  Please do not turn in something that will
clearly require another rewrite.
