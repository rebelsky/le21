**Background**: We look at the structure of arguments.

**The Basics**: 

1. Read/skim section III (Chapters 7--11) of _The Craft of Research_. 

2. Read your colleagues' introductions.

3. Skim your colleagues' outlines.

4. In the _Notes on Writing_ channel on Teams, post two important
points from _The Craft of Research_ that you'd like to remember.

**Audience**: Your audience for these notes is the rest of Tutorial.
That is me, your fellow Tutorial students, our Writing Mentors, and
the liaisons.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following [Tutorial
objectives](../handouts/objectives).

* 1\. Tutorial has been designated a writing-intensive course that introduces students to college-level writing.
* 1b\. Make appropriate stylistic and rhetorical choices with regard to audience, purpose, and context for each piece of writing
* 2c\. Understand how scholarly writing differs from popular writing and the conventions appropriate to their audience, purpose, and medium

**Anticipated uses**: We will use your work on this assignment in our
broader discussions of writing.  We may also do an exercise based
on this chapter of _Style_.
