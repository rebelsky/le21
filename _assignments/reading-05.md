**Background**: So far, we've explored two models of liberal arts
and liberal education and have also proposed future components of
liberal education.  It's time to expand our experience by looking
backward once again to explore the history of some models of liberal
education.

**The Basics**: 

_A. Read the following:_

1. The overview of Derek Bok's _Higher Expectations_, available
   online through JSTOR at
   <https://www-jstor-org.grinnell.idm.oclc.org/stable/j.ctv13vdhp1>.

2. Chapter one of Derek Bok's _Higher Expectations_, available
   online through JSTOR at 
   <https://www-jstor-org.grinnell.idm.oclc.org/stable/j.ctv13vdhp1>.

3. Wikipedia's article on the Great Books program, available
   at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_books>.

4. About the Columbia Core College Curriculum, available at
   <https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/center/visiting-prof/curriculum>.

5. A history of the Columbia College Core, available at
   <https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/timeline>

_B. Skim the following:_

1. The notes of Derek Bok's _Higher Expectations_, available
   online through JSTOR at 
   <https://www-jstor-org.grinnell.idm.oclc.org/stable/j.ctv13vdhp1>.

2. The index of Derek Bok's _Higher Expectations_, available
   online through JSTOR at 
   <https://www-jstor-org.grinnell.idm.oclc.org/stable/j.ctv13vdhp1>.

3. John W. Boyer's _The New Plan and the Origins of General
   Education at Chicago_, available at
   <https://humanities-web.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/college-prod/s3fs-public/documents/John's%20White%20Papers/Boyer_Cosmos_WEB.pdf>.
   This is a long piece and I do not expect you to read all of it.  You 
   should spend approximately fifteen minutes with it.

_C. Post the following to our Liberal Education channel on Teams:_

1. Two notes about things you'd like to remember from the readings.
Make sure to make each a separate post.

2. A note about which two chapters of Bok you'd like to read next
and why.

3. A source from Bok's notes that you might want to follow up on
and why.

4. Two terms that you saw in Bok's index that you'd like to see more
about.  (E.g., terms that might have led you to look back into the
book to see what Bok was writing.)

**Audience**: Your audience for these notes is the rest of Tutorial.
That is me, your fellow Tutorial students, our Writing Mentors, and
the liaisons.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following [Tutorial
objectives](../handouts/objectives).

* 2a\. Describe the form and function of different kinds of texts (which may include a film, image, poem, data set, etc.)
* 2b\. Identify the audience, purpose, and issues at stake in different kinds of texts
* 4c\. Recognize that there are different information source types that will be appropriate for different academic purposes. For example: background/reference source, critical literature/secondary source, archival/primary source.
* 7a\. Describe at least three models of liberal arts education, including both Grinnell’s “The Six Elements of a Liberal Arts Education at Grinnell” and a more holisitic model, such as the one William Cronon details in “Only Connect”.

**Anticipated uses**: We will use the results in our discussion of
potential topics for Tutorial.  You may also use the ideas in writing
your longer research paper.

**Note**: If you have trouble obtaining the readings from Bok, let me
know and I will send you copies.
