_Note: This assignment traditionally assumes that you are taking more
than two courses.  I've preserved it for this Tutorial because it
is still worth exploring some of the basic issues._

1. Gather the schedules and syllabi from each of your courses this term or semester, including the due dates of any homework assignments and exams. If your instructors have not provided you with a list of assignments and exams, ask them for that information. (Ask in a polite way, since they may not have that information available yet.)

2. For each category of work, make a list of the major assignments and their due dates. (You need not include daily readings and such.) Indicate how much time you expect each to take.

3. Summarize your expected regular work in each class. By regular work I mean the work that you have to do for each class or each week of class, such as readings, studying for quizzes, or regular homework assignments . Indicate how long you expect that work to take.
