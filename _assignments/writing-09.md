title: Writing Assignment 9
subtitle: Reflecting on our work
summary: | 
  For this assignment, you will provide me and your peers
  with a table of contents for our class anthology and either (a) a
  short (3-4 page) introduction to the anthology or (b) a cover for
  the anthology and a short explanation for why you designed the table
  of contents in the way you did.
audience: |
  Like your essays, the introduction and cover are
  intended for a general audience, one that has some understanding
  of American Higher education and is interested in learning a bit
  more.  If you prefer, you might decide that your audience is primarily
  Grinnellians (alumni, students, staff and faculty, prospective
  students and parents).
purpose: |
  The primary purpose of this assignment is to get you
  to reflect on the work we've done and how it interrelates.  I hope
  it encourages you to revisit your colleagues' work and to think
  about its relationship to the overall Tutorial theme.  We also have
  a practical purpose: The anthology needs a cover and an introduction.
collaboration: |
  Each student should submit their own responses to this assignment. You may
  consult other students in the class as you review the course materials. If you
  receive help from anyone, make sure to cite them in your responses. 
submitting: |
  Please email your work to me before class.

We will be assembling all of the papers from this class into an
anthology.  If all goes well, copies of the anthology will be printed
and made available for the 50th anniversary of the open curriculum.
That anthology will need an introduction and a cover.  In this
assignment, you will have the opportunity to consider how the
materials we've created should be arranged and presented.

**_The Table of Contents_**

As you've likely realized by now, the ordering of materials in an
anthology are rarely haphazard.  An editor (or group of editors)
has explored appropriate orders to present the material, considering
how the different parts might support or challenge each other.  In
many cases, they have also grouped them into larger sections.

Your goal in creating the table of contents is to do much the same.
Among other things, you might consider what "story" you are telling
with the materials and what you think the focus of our anthology
should be.  You may also want to reflect on what to do with ancillary
materials; should they be grouped together, perhaps as appendices,
or do you add interest by interspersing them amongst the essays?

Your table of contents should be in outline form and include all
of the following materials.

* The longer essays you and your peers wrote.
* Your early essays about new components to the liberal arts.  (I
  will not require you to include these essays in the anthology.  However,
  for the purposes of this assignment you should assume we've decided
  to nclude them.)
* Beryl Clotfelter's essay on the origins of the open curriculum
  (Assuming I can get permission to include it.)
* Our interview summaries.
* Any other materials you consider it relevant to include in the anthology.

You should not include page numbers as those will depend on a variety
of factors.  Your primary goals are ordering and grouping.

**_The Introduction_**

A good introduction provides some guidance and background for the
reader and also explains the ordering of materials.  Ideally, your
introduction should create a context for the essays and other
materials and should place each within that context.  You introduction
might also explain the path of ideas that runs through the essays.

Your introduction should also demonstrate that you've thought broadly
about the topics in this tutorial, particularly Liberal Education and
Grinnell's approach to Liberal Education.

Aim for about 750 to 1000 words.

**_The Cover_**

Book covers, like many problems in design, can take multiple
approaches.  Some covers bear little relationship to the content.
Others tie directly to a part of the content, such as the illustration
of an important scene or character from a novel.  Some place the
work in relation to others, such as orange Penguin Covers.  In the
end, though, a cover serves to draw the reader to a book.

Your cover should reveal important characteristics of our anthology,
including something about Liberal Education and the approaches we
take to Liberal Education throughout the text.  Your cover should
reveal to me (and to your peers) that you've analyzed and understood
the work of your colleagues, perhaps by representing common themes.

Your cover must include a title, which you may choose.  In most
cases, you will find it useful to include an image or images.  If
you do not create the images yourself, make sure that they are
images that you have appropriate permission to use, such as through
a Creative Commons license.

Remember that if you are doing a cover, you should also provide an
explanation for the table of contents (see the next section for
more details).

**_The Explanation of the Table of Contents_**

Ideally, you have spent some time considering the appropriate
ordering and grouping of materials for the table of contents.  Those
writing introductions have likely explained your choice of ordering
in the introduction.  Those of you creating book covers have not
had the opportunity to do so.  Hence, I would like you to write a
short (approximately one page) explanation of your table of contents.
This explanation is not intended for publication, so it should
require a bit less attention than you might otherwise give.  However,
I do expect correct grammar and logical flow of ideas.  Ideally,
you have made Williams' principles a habit, and those will appear
naturally in your writing.

**What to turn in**:

* (i) A table of contents 
* For the introduction: (ii) Your first smooth draft, with your
  notes and (iii) the final draft.
* For the cover: (ii) your
  sketch, (iii) the final version, and (iv) a short explanation of
  why you have ordered the contents in the way you did.  Note that I
  have not asked you for a statement about your cover design; most
  covers are supposed to stand on their, and yours should, too.
