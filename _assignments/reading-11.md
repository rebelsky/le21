**Background**: We review our peers' work.

**The Basics**: 

1. Read your colleagues' introductions.  Be prepared to make suggestions
on how they might improve those introductions.

**Audience**: You are not writing anything, so you have no audience
for this assignment.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following [Tutorial
objectives](../handouts/objectives).

* 1\. Tutorial has been designated a writing-intensive course that introduces students to college-level writing.
* 1b\. Make appropriate stylistic and rhetorical choices with regard to audience, purpose, and context for each piece of writing
* 2c\. Understand how scholarly writing differs from popular writing and the conventions appropriate to their audience, purpose, and medium

**Anticipated uses**: We will use your work on this assignment in our
broader discussions of our peers' work.  You will also use what you
have learned about your colleagues' work in an essay later in the
semester.
