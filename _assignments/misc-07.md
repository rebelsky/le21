**Background:** While we participate in a variety of discussions, we
rarely think about the form or structure of those discussions.  In
this assignment, you will reflect on one of our discussions.

**Assignment:**

Observe a class discussion and prepare a diagram that represents
the first forty utterences from your assigned class discussion (see
below for assignments of students to discussions). The diagram
should represent the flow and relationship of ideas in the discussion.

Your diagram should have the following characteristics:

* Draw a "bubble" for each non-trivial utterence. That bubble should document the key point of the utterence and the type of utterence. (question, fact, expansion of prior idea, etc.) You should represent the point textually. It is up to you how you represent the type of utterence; you might use shape, color, text, or something else.
* You can choose whether or not to represent utterences from the participants and from the discussion leader differently.
* Connect utterences in sequence by a solid line.
* When an utterence does not directly relate to the immediately previous utterence, draw an X through the solid line.
* Connect utterences that build upon earlier utterences by a dotted line.
* When possible, annotate these connections with the relationship between the two points.
* Include a *legend* that explains the different kinds of notation you used.
* Write your name at the bottom right corner of the diagram.

**Preparation:**

On your assigned day, you will act as an observer, rather than as
a participant, in discussion. Your goals as observer will be to
listen carefully to the discussion, to record the key points of the
discussion, and to gather any other information you need to draw
the diagram described above.

**Followup:**

On the Monday after our discussion week, we will post the diagrams on
the wall, examine them, and discuss implications we see in them.

**Example:**

I have purposefully skipped an example to allow each of you to use your
own creativity in designing and creating the diagram.

**Grading:**

* _Content_ [4 points]: Does the diagram accurately reflect the content of the discussion and the speakers?
* _Analysis_ [4 points]: How well does the diagram reflect the variety of kinds of utterences that were made during the discussion? Are appropriate connections represented? Are threads of ideas clear (and correct)?
* _Format_ [2 points]: How well does the diagram use visual cues to represent different kinds of information?

**Learning Goals:**

* To consider more carefully the structure of discussions and the kinds of utterences that are made during discussions.
* To encourage you to listen more carefully to classmates.
* To give you experience thinking in a different form (visually, in addition to verbally).

**Acknowledgements:** I wrote the original version of this assignment
in June 2005 as part of a Grinnell College workshop on Oral
Communication.  I received helpful feedback on the assignment from
my peers in that workshop.  In writing the assignment I was inspired,
in part, by a separate speech by Jon Chenette on the roles of
non-verbal communiation in the liberal arts.  The assignment has
evolved over the years since then.
