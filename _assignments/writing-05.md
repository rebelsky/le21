**The basics**: Write a 400--600-word draft introduction to your
research paper.  You should consider it a "draft" primarily in that
you should expect to change it.  Your introduction should emphasize
clear writing, exhibit correct grammar, and demonstrate your mastery
of the principles of style.

**Special Characteristics**: Your introduction must include

* at least one block quotation;
* at least one short quotation; and
* at least one summary or paraphrase of another piece of writing.

**Purposes**: I intend this assignment and your work for the assignment to provide a variety of benefits. In particular, I expect that they will

* help you organize your thoughts about your research topic;
* help you formulate a thesis for your research paper;
* prepare us for in-class discussions; and
* help you reflect on proper use of sources.

More details appear in the list of target outcomes.

**Audience**: As in most cases, you are writing for a general audience.
They will not be as informed about liberal education as your are, but
will be interested in the topic.  Your goal is to entice the reader to
continue reading your paper.

**Citation Guidelines**: Use APA style.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following [Tutorial
learning objectives](../handouts/objectives).

* 1a. Employ a deliberate and iterative writing process that includes brainstorming, planning, gathering evidence, drafting, and revising
* 1b. Make appropriate stylistic and rhetorical choices with regard to audience, purpose, and context for each piece of writing
* 1c. Situate their own ideas within a critical conversation about a particular topic
* 1d. Revise a draft in response to specific feedback provided by their classmates, a peer writing mentor, and/or their instructor
* 1e. Use appropriate conventions for quoting and citing primary and secondary sources
* 4d. Select sources based on critical evaluation of the appropriateness, relevance, and timeliness of the information found to strategically explore a question in the context of their academic work.
* 4e. Articulate how a particular source or source type could be used in the course of academic writing or a particular writing assignment.
* 5d. Demonstrate basic ability to incorporate other peopleâ€™s words and ideas into their own writing by paraphrasing, summarizing, quoting (block quotes and snippets), and responding to an idea or argument.
* 5e. Correctly utilize at least one type of citation method and format.

Wow.  That's a lot for one little introduction, isn't it?

## FAQ

I don't have a thesis yet. What do I do?
  : I realize that we are fairly early in the research process. However, I also know from experience that most students more successfully study a topic if (1) they begin with some reasonable thesis and (2) they are prepared to revise that thesis if the materials guide them in a different direction. Hence, you must come up with a thesis for this introduction.

Why do I have to use sources in three different ways?
  : The College expects every Tutorial professor to give his or her tutees an assignment in which they write a paper that demonstrates the four kinds of use. I'd rather have you use materials in context than do an independent exercise.  I've also decided that the difference between "using ideas" and paraphrasing or summarizing is vague enough that I'm not asking you to differentiate.

Will we be doing another editing exercise with this assignment?
  : Of course.

I've never had to write a multi-paragraph introduction before. What do I do?
  : There are many kinds of successful introductions. I'd suggest that you start by writing a prospective outline. That outline will suggest some things that you might find it helpful to include in your introduction. (No, I would prefer that you not include the wonderful In Section 2, we will discuss ....) Your introduction lays the groundwork for the rest of your paper, so you may find it helpful to provide some background information and to raise some issues of conflict. (Hmmm ... note that quotations will help.)

You love vague advice, don't you?
  : Here's some specific advice:
      * Read chapter 16 of _The Craft of Research_
      * Read [the section on openings from _The College Writer's Handbook_](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?q1=%22Strong%20Openings%22;id=uc1.31822032375867;view=1up;seq=175;start=1;sz=10;page=root;num=151;size=100;orient=0).
        (Many Tutorials used to use this book.  You can read it online.  I'll 
        also send you the appropriate section.)
      * Speak with your writing mentor.
      * Make an appointment with the writing lab.

Won't we want to drop the quotations, paraphrase, and such from the final version of the introduction?
  : Not necessarily. A well-chosen group of quotations can set up an interesting conflict or position and thereby draw the reader in.

What if I have other questions?
  : Ask in class, email SamR, or message SamR in Teams.
