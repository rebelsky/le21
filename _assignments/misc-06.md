**Assignment**

Write a detailed outline of your paper that breaks your paper into
sections and approximately paragraph-sized units.  For each paragraph,
you should include notes on what you want to include in the paragraph
as well as a potential draft topic sentence for the paragraph.  For
a paper of this length, you should plan between twenty and thirty
paragraph-sized units.  (As you write, you will find that you expand
some paragraphs into more than one paragraph and that you will cut
others.)

Note that your primary goal is to get your ideas down and in some
potential order.  You need not (yet) incorporate the stylistic
measures we have discussed.

**Purposes**

This assignment serves primarily to help you make forward progress
on your large paper.  It gives you an opportunity to think through
your larger argument, to reflect on challenges, and to consider
options for presenting that argument.  We will use your responses 
for small-group discussions in class.

**An example**

Title: _On the intersection of image and text in modern education: Let's let liberal learning leverage LOLcats_

Thesis: While communication is at the heart of a liberal education,
too often liberal arts colleges focus solely on word-based
communication; to best prepare students to communicate in the
twenty-first century, such colleges must not only employ other modes
of communication, such as still and moving images, but also provide
students with the skills to read and interpret media the combine
text and image.  That is, we must teach students to read, interpret,
and create LOLcats.

I\. Introduction

* Introduce the liberal arts.  Discuss the role of communication.  Cite
  Cronon.  Perhaps cite Grinnell.
    * _Although the particular details schools associate with liberal
      education may differ, they share one important common attribute:
      A successful curriculum for liberal education must prepare
      students to communicate with others._
* Describe modern communication.  Images.  Video.  Sound (not just
  spoken word).  
    * _Communication in the 21st century incorporates a wide variety
      of media, not just written and spoken word, but also images
      (moving and still) and sound.  As importantly, communication
      also involves combinations of media._
* Raise a question.  
    * _How should a liberal education incorporate these new mechanisms of 
      communication, individually and as hybrids?_
* Thesis.
    * _While communication is at the heart of a liberal education,
too often liberal arts colleges focus solely on word-based
communication; to best prepare students to communicate in the
twenty-first century, such colleges must not only employ other modes
of communication, such as still and moving images, but also provide
students with the skills to read and interpret media the combine
text and image.  That is, we must teach students to read, interpret,
and create LOLcats._

II\. Communication in the 21st Century

* Background: The modern Interweb.  Cell phones.  Social media. More.
    * _The Interweb represents not just the network that enables
      this communication, but also the technologies built on top
      of it, particularly the World-Wide Web._
* Background: Rise of the Interweb.  Also bandwidth?
    * _Although the Internet has existed since the 1960's and the
      World-Wide Web was developed in the 1990's, it was only in
      the second decade of the 21st century that it became ingrained
      in the everyday lives of most Americans._
* Media variations.  Early days of interweb until now.
    * _While text plays an important role in the Interweb, users'
      everyday experience is filled with other media: sound, images,
      animated GIFs, 30-second videos, and more._
* Interweb literacy.  People learn implicitly, as they use the Interweb.
  However, that's not enough.  (Can I find sources to support this?
  Perhaps just the whole bubble thing.)
    * _Although this everyday experience gives most citizens of the
      Interweb confidence that they understand communication with
      this multiplicity of media, deep understanding requires
      more explicit training._
* Add complexity.  
    * _It's not enough to just train students to critically
      "read" these media; to communicate, one must also "write".
      Hence, schools have an obligation to teach the construction
      of these new kinds of non-textual "texts"._
    * Is that too many quotation marks?

III\. Why not focus on the basics?

* Long history of liberal education.  It's worked for hundreds of
  years (perhaps thousands).  It's been challenged for at least
  a hundred.  Does it really need to change?
    * _More than one-hundred years of American liberal education
      has demonstrated the capacity of a traditional liberal
      education---one focused on reading, writing, and speaking---to
      develop thinkers capable of adapting to a wide range of
      situations and media.  Given those past successes, does it
      really need to change?_
* Review adaptions.  A globalized world.  Widespread print literacy.
  Yellow journalism.  Radio.  Television.  Film.
    * _In just the twentieth century, liberally educated citizens
      needed to learn to adapt to a wide variety of new media,
      including film, radio, and then television.  In each case,
      the basic skills of a liberal education sufficed._
* Or did it?  Review the role of communication in a liberal education,
  drawing on Cronon.
    * _In the end, communication is core to a liberal education._
      and communication involves not just the consumption of media,
      but also its production_.
* Review the differences in media.
    * _Twenty-first century media differ from twentieth-century
      media in that the Interweb democratizes communication.  While
      few citizens would make a film or a television show, "anybody"
      can create a Web video, or mix sounds, or combine text and
      image, or ...._
* Ground in practice: Powerpoint.  Include McCloud's notes about the
  primacy of the visual?
    * _If graduates are already expected to employ
      multiple media in presentation software, will they not soon
      be expected to better communicate using other new modes?_

IV\. How to approach the problem?

* Propose one approach: Discuss these as broad skills, potentially
  devoid of context.
    * _Just as we teach students to write and not just to write
      one kind of paper, we should teach students broadly how to
      create these different kinds of media._
* How do we fit this into the curriculum?  Tutorial?  A required
  "Interweb communication" course?  Throughout the curriculum?
    * _Just as most classes include significant reading and
      writing instruction, so should most classes include
      significant instruction in new media interpretation and
      creation._
* A challenge: General knowledge does not always apply to the
  particular situation.  Political philosophies seem to break down
  when applied to particular situations (democracy, communinism, etc.)
    * _A primary criticism of liberal education is that it is 
      too separated from practice; hence, learning these materials
      must be grounded in particular genres and practices._
* Another challenge: The faculty.  How will they learn.
    * _If we are to engage faculty across the curriculum in teaching
      these new skills, we must acknowledge that many faculty
      lack expertise in modern media; to enable faculty to teach
      these skills, we must train faculty themselves._
* A natural conclusion / leading on to the next section.
    * _Hence, rather than focusing on broad skills, we should
      teach skills in the context of a particular multi-medium.
      But which one?_

V\. On LOLcats

* There are a wide variety of media on the Interweb.  Where should
  we start?
    * _How can we choose amongst these media?_
* Cats.  What else?
    * _As noted data science Pioneer Hilary Mason '00 notes, "Of
      all the things a visitor from the 19th century would find
      surprising, perhaps most surprising is that we carry a device
      capable of accessing all the world's knowledge in our pockets,
      and use it primarily for looking at cat pictures and videos."_
* Pictures alone do not suffice.  Need multiplicities.
    * _To enable true media literacy, we must look toward hybrid
      media, those that combine other media._
* Suggest medium
    * _Of course, the obvious cat-based genre of hybrid media is the 
      LOLcat._
* Insult the reader (always a good thing to do).
    * _For those uninformed readers unfamiliar with major Interweb tropes, 
      a LOLcat
      (or Lots of Love Cat) is a complex combination of photographs
      of cats with repurposed and modified language._
* Describe potential benefits.  Consideration of language.  
  Multiple juxtapositions (related, unrelated, somewhat related, etc.).
    * _The rich complexities associated with LOLcats provide ample
      opportunity for faculty and students to consider more broadly
      the modes of thinking necessary for 21st century literacy._
* Quickly dismiss concerns.
    * _Perhaps you feel that you are not alone in misunderstanding
      the LOLcat.  And you are likely correct.  Nonetheless, the
      rich communication permitted by the LOLcat genre will lead
      them (or media like them) to rise again and again throughout
      the future histories of the Interweb._

VI. Practical Considerations

* Introduce
    * _But how will we help faculty incorporate LOLcats throughout the
      curriculum?  Let's consider some particular examples._
* Sciences: The role of image in science.  Translates differently
  to LOLcats.
    * _Just as scientists quickly learn to start with the images
      in a paper, they will also find that they naturally find
      roles of LOLcats in presenting their material and in
      understanding the overall "picture" presented by a paper._
* Languages: Multilingual.
    * _One clear focus of the genre is the clever use or manipulatio
      of language.  Yet most LOLcats use English.  Imagine the opportunities
      to better understand the subtleties of a language and culture
      as you think carefully about what few words to place on the
      image of a cat._
* Social sciences: Cross-cultural critiques
    * _As the use of LOLcats grows and grows, members of the social
      sciences have the opportunity to use LOLcats for cross-cultural
      critiques._
* Cheat.
    * _The wide variety of uses of LOLcats in the other humanities
      and in the arts are so obvious that we will not even bother 
      to enumerate them._

VI. Conclusion

* Humans communicate.  Liberal artists communicate.
    * _Communication is central to the liberal arts; communication in
      the 21st century requires broader skills, both in interpreting
      communication and in communiating with others._
* LOLcats are the current epitome of communication.
    * _LOLcats represent one epitome of communication and shold
       therefore serve as a new core aspect of modern liberal education,
       one that should be included throughout the curriculum._
* As the use of LOLcats expands to other media (LOLcatgifs and LOLcattoks)
  this mode of communication will naturally expand.
    * _But this recommendation is not static; the use of LOLcats will
      naturally expand to other hybrid media, such as LOLcatgifs and
      LOLcattoks, bringing new resources and capabilities to 
      liberally educated students._

Notes to self: 

* The introduction provides a natural order to the essay.  And
  it could help the reader to see the essay phrased in the same
  way.  But perhaps it's better to experiment with other orders.
* Would a thesis-last essay work better?
