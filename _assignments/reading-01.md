**Background**: One of the primary tasks of Grinnell's _Tutorial_
is to make sure that you are ready for College-level writing.  Through
these readings, we begin to consider what kinds of things Grinnell
faculty will expect to see in your papers.

**The Basics**: 

1. Read the following.

    * [_Writing in College_](../files/writing-in-college.pdf) by Joseph Williams and Lawrence McEnerney.
    * The foreward to [_The Grinnell College Guide to Writing, Research, and Speaking_](https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2020-01/Grinnell%20College%20Guide%20to%20Writing%2C%20Research%2C%20and%20Speaking.pdf)
    * Chapter 1 of _Style_.
    * The [Tutorial Learning Objectives](../handouts/objectives).

2. As you're reading, look for two sentences you really like and one
sentence you find confusing.

3. Post those sentences to the _Sentences, Good and Bad_ channel
on Teams.  Make sure to give us enough information that we can find
them in context.  (E.g., "_Style_, p. 10, second paragraph".)  Also
indicate whether you consdier it a good sentence or a confusing
sentence.

4. In the _Writing_ channel on Teams, post three important points from
the readings that you'd like to remember.

**Audience**: Your audience for these notes is the rest of Tutorial.
That is me, your fellow Tutorial students, our Writing Mentors, and
the liaisons.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following [Tutorial
objectives](../handouts/outcomes).

* 1\. Tutorial has been designated a writing-intensive course that introduces students to college-level writing.
* 2c\. Understand how scholarly writing differs from popular writing and the conventions appropriate to their audience, purpose, and medium

**Anticipated uses**: We will use your work on this assignment in our
discussions of the purpose of Tutorial and broader discussions of 
writing.  We will also use the sentences for future exercises in
sentence-level writing issues.  The chapter from _Style_ will lead to
other exercises.
