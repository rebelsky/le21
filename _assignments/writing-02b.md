**Background**: This assignment shares the background of [writing
assignment 1](writing-01).  That is, it gives you an opportunity
to envision what might be part of a 21st century liberal education.

**The basics**: Using what you've learned from the discussion of
essays what you've seen in your peer essays, and my own comments
on your essay (to be distributed on Friday), write a 500--750 word
essay on the same topic you used for homework 1.  Your new essay
can incorporate as much or as little of the original essay as you
choose, but it must argue for the same component.

In addition, write a short note (approx. 250 words) on what you
learned from this exercise (that is, of having others look for
particular points in your essay and giving suggestions, of reflecting
on others' similar work, and of rewriting your essay at least one more 
time than you expected to).

**Audience**: Your audience remains the same as in [writing assignment
1](writing-01).

**Target outcomes**: In addition to the goals stated in [writing
assignment 1](writing-01), this assignment relates to the following 
goals of Tutorial.

* 1.d. Revise a draft in response to specific feedback provided by their classmates, a peer writing mentor, and/or their instructor
* 2.d. Identify how a work of scholarship participates in an ongoing conversation about a particular topic

**Citations**

You should follow the same citation practices described in homework 1.
In addition, you should acknowledge the contributions of your readers.
You need not acknowledge my contributions.

**Preparatory process**

1. Write an essay.  You've done that already.

2. Share your essay with two or three peers in class.  

3. Read and comment on two of your peers' essays, using our [Tutorial
writing review form](../rubrics/writing).  You should also answer
the following two questions in the essay-specific session of that
form.

    * What is another reason to require or recommend this new component of
      a liberal education?
    * What is another objection one might raise to this new component?

4. Discuss your answers with your peers.

**Primary process**

1. Decide on where and how your writing mentor can help in the revision
process.  They might, for example, help you work through the comments
you've received, look at where to incorporate those comments, help you
think about how to restructure the essay, or respond to a new draft.

2. Make an appointment with your writing mentor.

3. Read through the comments you've received on your essay.  In addition
to the comments you receive from two peers, you will also receive 
comments from me (on Friday).

4. Sketch a new structure to your essay.

5. Rewrite your essay.

6. Consider rewriting the esssay again.

7. Reflect on what you learned from this process.

8. Express those reflections in a short note, which you email to me.

**Post-processing**

1. On Monday, you will distribute your essays to your peers at the start of
class.

2. You will read each others' essays before class on Tuesday.

3. On Tuesday, we will discuss the essays and related issues that arose
in our work and reading.

**Additional notes**

* Please email me your essay as a Microsoft Word document.
* Make sure that your essay has a title.
* Make sure that your essay includes the traditional header: author, class, instructor, assignment, date (on separate lines).
* Make sure to number your pages.
