**Background**: As we start to move forward and delve more deeply into
our topics, we will want or need to rely on a variety of sources to
ground and build our understanding and arguments.  In this assignment,
you will read about kinds of sources and ways to use them.

**The Basics**: 

1. Read Chapter 5 (From Problems to Sources) and Chapter 6 (Engaging
Sources) from _The Craft of Research_, 3rd Edition.

2. By 8pm Sunday CDT, post two important points from the readings
that you'd like to remember in the _Library Research_ channel on
Teams.  Please make each point a separate post (the start of a
separate thread).

3. Before class time on Monday, post at least four followup messages
on posts from other people.  Strive to post to the less crowded
threads.  (We should average at least two responses per thread.)

**Audience**: Your audience for these notes is the rest of Tutorial.
That is me, your fellow Tutorial students, our Writing Mentors, and
the liaisons.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following [Tutorial
objectives](../handouts/objectives).

* 4\. The tutorial initially acquaints students with a librarian and library resources.
* 4c\. Recognize that there are different information source types that will be appropriate for different academic purposes. For example: background/reference source, critical literature/secondary source, archival/primary source.
* 4e\. Articulate how a particular source or source type could be used in the course of academic writing or a particular writing assignment.

**Anticipated uses**: We will use the results of this exercise in
our meetings with our Chris Jones, our Library Partner.  You will
likely use the ideas in writing your longer research paper.
