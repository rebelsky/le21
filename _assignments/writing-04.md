**Background**: Bibliographies serve many purposes. They ground
your work in a broader community. They tell your readers that you've
read widely on your subject matter. They remind you to read widely
on a subject matter. They can even provide reading lists for those
interested in a subject.

Those who use bibliographies as reading lists appreciate more than
a simple citation as they decide where to read further. In particular,
they benefit from your comments. When you add short comments to a
bibliography, you produce a work we might call an annotated
bibliography.

On the subject of annotated bibliographies, the 14th Edition of the
_Chicago Manual of Style_ says

> When a bibliography is intended to direct the reader to other
works for further reading and study, an annotated bibliography is
useful. This is a list of books (sometimes articles as well) in
alphabetical order with comments appended to some or all of the
entries. The comments may be run in ... or set on separate lines.

**Sample bibliography entries**: Forthcoming.

**The Assignment**

1. Pick six authoritative sources that you anticipate using for
your research paper.

2. Read each of those sources carefully.

3. Write a moderate-sized paragraph about each source. The paragraph
should discuss the type of source (e.g., is it a journal article,
newspaper article, opinion piece, etc.), primary point or points
the source makes, the authority of the source (e.g., background on
the authors that might not be otherwise apparant), limitations of
the source, and any other potentially interesting aspects of the
source.

**Audience**: You are writing for your classmates. Your reader is
generally interested in the subject of liberal education, but perhaps
not in your particular subarea.

*Reference guidelines*: Please use MLA-style references.

Purposes: I intend this assignment and your work for the assignment to provide a variety of benefits. In particular, I expect that they will

* help you further organize your thoughts about your research topic;
* give you the opportunity to visit your sources in more depth;
* encourage you to revisit the notion of an "authoritative" source; and
* give you experience in a different kind of writing.

**References used**: In writing this assignment, I referred to the following sources (not all of which I agree with).
