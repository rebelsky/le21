title: Potential interview subjects
---
I've identified a variety of people on campus who are likely to
provide you with a valuable perspective.  You might also suggest
others.  (The list is woefully incomplete; these are the ones that
came to mind as I reflect on people and the topics you have raised.)
Note that I am still in the process of confirming that these folks
are willing to be interviewed.

Jon Andelson '70
  : Andelson is both an alum and a faculty member.  As someone who
    was a student at Grinnell when the Tutorial and open curriculum
    were first created and as a faculty member soon after their creation,
    Andelson will have a unique perspective on how Grinnell education has
    evolved over the past fifty years.  Andelson also served as director
    of the College's Center for Prairie studies and is likely to 
    have strong opinions on how our location shapes and might shape
    a Grinnell edcation.

Tim Arner
  : Arner is a faculty member in English and is currently serving
    as an Associate Dean.  As Associate Dean, Arner has taken the
    lead in developing Tutorial.

George Drake '56
  : Drake is Professor Emeritus of History and former President of
    Grinnell.  He was also Dean at Colorado at about the time the
    block plan was introduced.  Drake instituted Scholars' Convocation 
    in his time as Grinnell President.  As a person on campus with 
    knowledge about Grinnell across multiple decades and as someone
    who has steered the College, Drake will likely have valuable
    insights about Grinnell education and the future of liberal
    education.

David Feldman '70
  : Feldman graduated in 1970 with Grinnell's first independent
    major.  He is an active alumnus and is also the author of
    the "Imponderables" series of books.  He could be a good
    resource on the state of Grinnell at the time Tutorial and
    the open curriculum were created.  And, as someone who studies
    a wide variety of topics, he may also have useful opinions
    on the future of liberal education.

Katya Gibel Mevorach
  : Gibel Mevorach is Professor of Anthropology and a long-serving
    member of the Grinnell faculty.  As a faculty member, Gibel
    Mevorach has been outspoken about many aspects of Grinnell's
    curriculum (and has helped shape my own opinion about that
    curriculum).  I do not know what she would say about the past
    our the future, but I expect it will be an exciting interview.

Kim Gilbert '82
  : Gilbert is a member of the library staff and an alum from the
    early 1980's.  As an alum and a long-serving staff member, Gilbert
    is likely to have unique perspectives on the different aspects
    of Grinnell education.

Andy Hamilton '85
  : Hamilton is the Director of Athletics and Recreation and a
    graduate of the class of 1985.  As we look back, Hamilton 
    will likely be able to reflect on changes in Grinnell education 
    over the past forty or so years.  As we look ahead, Hamilton
    is likely to provide insights based on his experience and his
    roles.

Anne Harris
  : Harris is President of Grinnell College.  It is clear that 
    Harris' vision is one of the reasons chose her to lead Grinnell.
    Harris might also be useful in providing an outsider's view
    of the primary components of a Grinnell education.

Jen Jacobsen '95
  : As a student, Jacobsen worked with historian Al Jones on
    _Pioneering_, a history of Grinnell.  Jacobsen also served
    as the College's Student Wellness coordinator for a number
    of years and is now assessing the new First Year Experience
    course.  I learn something from Jen each time we talk, and
    I expect she'd have thoughtful things to say about the past
    and the future.

Chris Jones
  : Jones serves as the College's archivist.  In that role, he is 
    likely to know of a variety of (potentially surprising) aspects 
    of the College's modes of education.

David Lopatto
  : Lopatto is Professor of Psychology, Samuel R. and Marie-Louise
    Rosenthal Professor of Natural Science, and the Director of
    Grinnell's Center for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment.  Lopatto's
    long experience at Grinnell and his work directing the Center suggest
    that he will have unique insights on Grinnell's past and on 
    modern liberal education.

Elaine Marluff
  : Marzluff is Acting Dean of Grinnell College and Breid-Mcfarland 
    Professor of Science.  As Dean, Marzluff is responsible for the
    academic program at Grinnell.  Marzluff also has more than
    twenty years of experience teaching at Grinnell.

Celeste Miller
  : Miller is Associate Professor of Theatre and Dance and is our
    lead faculty member in Dance.  In that role, Miller is likely
    to have a somewhat different perspective on liberal education,
    perhaps including the (understated) roles of the arts and of
    non-textual communication in modern liberal education.

Wayne Moyer
  : Moyers is one of Grinnell's longest-serving faculty members, having
    started her as an instructor in 1972.  He's is also former
    director of the College's Rosenfield program.  Moyer is likely
    to provide thoughtful and useful reflections on nearly five
    decades of Tutorial at Grinnell.  His expertise in public affairs
    and international relations will likely lead to some great
    insights on liberal education in a time of globalization and
    complex politics.

Nino Parker '07
  : Parker is Senior Associate Director of Alumni and Donor
    Relations and a graduate from this century.  (I mention
    that, in part, because I've included a lot of graduates
    from the prior century in my list.)  Parker can provide
    insight into how alums view Grinnell and Grinnell education,
    helping us look both backward and ahead.  Parker's insights
    about his own time at Grinnell are also likely to serve
    us well.

Sarah J. Purcell '92
  : Purcell is L F Parker Professor of History and an alumna of
    Grinnell.  Purcell has served a wide variety of roles, including
    College Parliamentarian and Director of the Rosenfield program.
    Purcell has also been a leader in looking at new directions in
    education, incorporating virtual reality in her research and
    spearheading the College's Digital Liberal Arts program.

Henry Rietz '89
  : Rietz is Professor of Religious Studies.  For our purposes,
    it is equally important that Rietz is an alumnus and regularly
    teaches Tutorials related to Grinnell (its history, the identity
    of Grinnellians, etc.).  As Religion and Religious Studies have
    played a variety of roles in the history of lieral education,
    Rietz is likely to provide some insight as the to roles they
    might play in the future.

Fredo Rivera '06
  : Rivera is a member of the Art History faculty and an alumnus
    fro the class of 2006.  In my experiences with Fredo (primarily
    as a faculty member), I have found him deeply thoughtful 
    about many things.  I expect he can speak well to the successes
    and flaws of Grinnell education in his years as a student at
    Grinnell as well as suggest ways Grinnell education (and all
    liberal education) might evolve.

Schvalla Rivera
  : Rivera is the College's Chief Diversity Officer.  Particularly
    as we see increasing need for students (and all citizens) to have
    deeper understanding of diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
    anti-racism, she can provide valuable insights on how a liberal
    education for the future can best incorporate these areas.

Vickie Rutherford
  : Rutherford is Assistant Registrar and has served in the Registrar's
    office for multiple decades.  As Assistant Registrar, she's seen
    changes in requirements and policies, considered the kinds of
    schedules students put together, and more.  Rutherford is likely
    to provide us with very different kinds of insights.

Maure Smith-Benanti
  : Smith-Benanti is the College's Dean for Diversity, Equity, and 
    Inclusion.  In that role, she regularly reflects on the ways
    Grinnell's modes of education do and do not serve important
    roles.  Smith-Benanti is also a key lead in the design and
    implementation of the new First-Year Experience course, a
    course that is likely to become the fifth component of a
    Grinell education.

Joyce Stern '91
  : Stern serves as Dean for Student Success and Academic Advising.
    In that role, Stern has primary responsibility for Tutorial.
    As Dean for Student Success, Stern can also provide insight on
    skills that will likely be useful for the future.  As an alum,
    Stern can reflect back on the various components of Grinnell
    education and how they and their roles have changed in the past
    thirty years.

Susan Sanning
  : Sanning is Associate Dean & Director of Service & Social Innovation
    in the Center for Careers, Life, and Service (CLS).  Sanning has
    deep insights on the roles of community service (and more) in 
    education and reflects regularly on the relationship between
    college education and post-graduate outcomes.

Tisha Turk
  : Turk runs Grinnell's Center for Writing, Reading, and Speaking
    and is likely to have valuable views on Tutorial (looking back)
    and on academic skills for the future (looking ahead).

Carle VanWilligen
  : VanWilligen is Director of Institutional Research at Grinnell.
    In that role, she has done more with data about Grinnell than
    almost anyone else I know.  I do not know what insights she
    can (or is allowed to) share, but I do know that I always find
    her insightful.
