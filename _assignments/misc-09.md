title: Miscellaneous Assignment 9
subtitle: Covering the anthology
summary: | 
  For this assignment, you will provide me and your peers
  with a table of contents for our class anthology, and
  explanation of the table of contents, and a cover for
  the anthology.
audience: |
  Like your essays, cover intended for a general audience, one that
  has some understanding of American Higher education and is
  interested in learning a bit more.  If you prefer, you might
  decide that your audience is primarily Grinnellians (alumni,
  students, staff and faculty, prospective students and parents).
purpose: |
  The primary purpose of this assignment is to get you
  to reflect on the work we've done and how it interrelates.  I hope
  it encourages you to revisit your colleagues' work and to think
  about its relationship to the overall Tutorial theme.  It also
  provides an opportunity to exercise a bit of a different part of
  your brain.
collaboration: |
  Each student should submit their own responses to this assignment. You may
  consult other students in the class as you review the course materials. If you
  receive help from anyone, make sure to cite them in your responses. 
submitting: |
  Please email your work to me before class.

We will be assembling all of the papers from this class into an
anthology of sorts.   That anthology will need a cover.  You are
responsible for that cover.  You are also responsible for the 
ordering.

**_The Table of Contents_**

As you've likely realized by now, the ordering of materials in an
anthology are rarely haphazard.  An editor (or group of editors)
has explored appropriate orders to present the material, considering
how the different parts might support or challenge each other.  In
many cases, they have also grouped them into larger sections.

Your goal in creating the table of contents is to do much the same.
Among other things, you might consider what "story" you are telling
with the materials and what you think the focus of our anthology
should be.  You may also want to reflect on what to do with ancillary
materials; should they be grouped together, perhaps as appendices,
or do you add interest by interspersing them amongst the essays?

Your table of contents should be in outline form and include all
of the following materials.

* The longer essays you and your peers wrote.
* Your early essays about new components to the liberal arts.  (I
  will not require you to include these essays in the anthology.  However,
  for the purposes of this assignment you should assume we've decided
  to nclude them.)
* Beryl Clotfelter's essay on the origins of the open curriculum
  (Assuming I can get permission to include it.)
* Our interview summaries.
* Any other materials you consider it relevant to include in the anthology.

You should not include page numbers as those will depend on a variety
of factors.  Your primary goals are ordering and grouping.

**_The Cover_**

Book covers, like many problems in design, can take multiple
approaches.  Some covers bear little relationship to the content.
Others tie directly to a part of the content, such as the illustration
of an important scene or character from a novel.  Some place the
work in relation to others, such as orange Penguin Covers.  In the
end, though, a cover serves to draw the reader to a book.

Your cover should reveal important characteristics of our anthology,
including something about Liberal Education and the approaches we
take to Liberal Education throughout the text.  Your cover should
reveal to me (and to your peers) that you've analyzed and understood
the work of your colleagues, perhaps by representing common themes.

Your cover must include a title, which you may choose.  In most
cases, you will find it useful to include an image or images.  If
you do not create the images yourself, make sure that they are
images that you have appropriate permission to use, such as through
a Creative Commons license.

**_The Explanation of the Table of Contents_**

Ideally, you have spent some time considering the appropriate
ordering and grouping of materials for the table of contents.  Those
writing introductions have likely explained your choice of ordering
in the introduction.  Those of you creating book covers have not
had the opportunity to do so.  Hence, I would like you to write a
short (approximately one page) explanation of your table of contents.
This explanation is not intended for publication, so it should
require a bit less attention than you might otherwise give.  However,
I do expect correct grammar and logical flow of ideas.  Ideally,
you have made Williams' principles a habit, and those will appear
naturally in your writing.

**What to turn in**:

* (i) A table of contents,
* (ii) your sketch, 
* (iii) the final version, and 
* (iv) a short explanation of why you have ordered the contents in the way you did.  

Note that I have not asked you for a statement about your cover
design; most covers are supposed to stand on their, and yours should,
too.
