title: Miscellaneous Assignment 9
subtitle: Covering our work
summary: | 
  For this assignment, you will provide me with a cover for our
  imagined class anthology.
audience: |
  Like your essays, you cover is intended for a general audience,
  one that has some understanding of American Higher education and
  is interested in learning a bit more.  If you prefer, you might
  decide that your audience is primarily Grinnellians (alumni,
  students, staff and faculty, prospective students and parents).
purpose: |
  The primary purpose of this assignment is to get you to think
  about our material and how it interreleates in a different way,
  visually, rather than textually.  It should provide an opportunity
  to exercise a bit of a different part of your brain.
collaboration: |
  Each student should submit their own responses to this assignment.
  You may consult other students in the class as you review the
  course materials. If you receive help from anyone, make sure to
  cite them in your responses.
submitting: |
  Please email your work to me at least thirty minutes before class.

As I've suggested, we will be assembling all of the papers from this
class into an anthology of sorts.   That anthology will need a
cover.  You are responsible for that cover.  

**_The Cover_**

Book covers, like many problems in design, can take multiple
approaches.  Some covers bear little relationship to the content.
Others tie directly to a part of the content, such as the illustration
of an important scene or character from a novel.  Some place the
work in relation to others, such as orange Penguin Covers.  In the
end, though, a cover serves to draw the reader to a book.

Your cover should reveal important characteristics of our anthology,
including something about Liberal Education and the approaches we
take to Liberal Education throughout the text.  Your cover should
reveal to me (and to your peers) that you've analyzed and understood
the work of your colleagues, perhaps by representing common themes.

Your cover must include a title, which you may choose.  In most
cases, you will find it useful to include an image or images.  If
you do not create the images yourself, make sure that they are
images that you have appropriate permission to use, such as through
a Creative Commons license.

**What to turn in**:

* (i) Your sketch of the cover
* (ii) The final version of your cover

Note that I have not asked you for a statement about your cover
design. Most covers are supposed to stand on their own; yours should,
too.  (If you think a cover statement would help, you may include
one.)

**Grading rubric**

* Presents the breadth of topics included in the text (4 points).
* Indicates that it's about liberal education and/or liberal arts (2 points).
* Attractive; something someone might buy (or at least pick up on
  a "free book" table) (2 points).
