**Purposes**: (1) To provide you with sources you can use to develop
your research topic in more depth. (2) To give you experience using
a research librarian or other library resources. (3) To remind you
of the relative import of different kinds of sources.

**Background**: In order to write an interesting and compelling
essay (and lead a productive discussion) on your chosen topic, you
will need to identify sources that can help you think about the
topic and that can support the conclusions you reach. Finding sources
clearly requires multiple steps. Most scholars find that its best
to begin by making a bibliography of potentially useful sources.
You don't find the sources themselves at this point; you simply
list them. Once you've identified a large list of potential sources,
you decide which you want to explore in more depth (and which you
can actually get), find them, peruse them, and make a further
selection. The process is also somewhat cyclic. As you read sources,
you will also find more potentially useful sources.

**Assignment**: Create a bibliography of at least twenty potentially
useful sources for studying your selected topic. You need not obtain
all of these sources at this point, but you will find it useful to
obtain some of them. You certainly need not read any of the sources.

* At least four of your sources should be articles from the popular press.
* At least four of your sources should be articles from journals, such as journals of law or the social sciences.
* At least four of your sources should be opinion essays posted to the Web.
* At least four of your sources should be some other kind of source.  You
  might consider extant (or prospective) interviews, archival documents,
  collections of information, other kinds of Web pages, and so on and
  so forth.

Please list your potential sources in *Chicago* format.

**Where to start**:
I'd strongly recommend that you make an appointment with a research librarian for help. When you make the appointment, you should let the librarian know your topic. You should also let him or her know the details of this assignment, which is available on the World Wide Web at http://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Tutorial/2020F/Assignments/misc-04.html

You should also use the various techniques we discussed in class.
You can also meet with me to discuss possible sources (although I
will admit that I am much worse at identifying these kinds of sources
than the librarians are).

**Post-processing**: After you complete this assignment, you should also
expect to do the following.

* Find, read, and annotate six of the sources you have identified.
* Select a few of those sources to assign as readings to your peers.
* Lead a discussion based on those sources.
* Quote some of those sources in a short essay.
* Use many of those sources in your longer essay.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following [Tutorial
learning objectives](../handouts/objectives).

* 4a. Read, interpret and use citations to access materials (find full text, find in library, request via Interlibrary Loan).
* 4b. Employ different research tools, such as the library catalog, library databases, and web search engines, based on an understanding of the different resources they offer.
* 4c. Recognize that there are different information source types that will be appropriate for different academic purposes. For example: background/reference source, critical literature/secondary source, archival/primary source.
* 4d. Select sources based on critical evaluation of the appropriateness, relevance, and timeliness of the information found to strategically explore a question in the context of their academic work.
* 4e. Articulate how a particular source or source type could be used in the course of academic writing or a particular writing assignment.
