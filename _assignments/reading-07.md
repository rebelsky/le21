**Background**: As you know (or should know), academic honesty and
academic integrity form one of [the six primary Tutorial learning
objectives](../handouts/objectives).  The College strongly enourages
us to explore academic honesty and integrity through [the College's
handbook on academic honesty](https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2020-08/2020-21_Academic_Honesty.pdf), and so we shall.

**The Basics**: 

1. Read [_Academic Honesty: Scholarly Integrity, Collaboration, and the Ethical Use of Sources_](https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2020-08/2020-21_Academic_Honesty.pdf).

2. Read "[The Original Renegade](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/the-original-renegade.html)", an article by _Taylor Lorenz_ from _The New York Times_ pubished February 13, 2020 and updated July 16, 2020.

3. Post one thing you found surprising or unexpected from the handbook in the "Unexpected ideas" thread in the _Academic Honesty_ channel.

4. Post one thing you want to remember from the handbook in the "Things to remember" thread in the _Academic Honesty_ channel.

5. What do you see as relationships between the issues raised in _Academic Honesty_ and those raised in the _Times_ article?  Post an answer in the "Academic honesty and TikTok culture" channel.

**Audience**: Your audience for these notes is the rest of Tutorial.
That is me, your fellow Tutorial students, our Writing Mentors, and
the liaisons.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following [Tutorial
objectives](../handouts/objectives).

* 5\. Tutorial introduces students to academic honesty policies and practices at Grinnell, including both correct citation practices and discussion of issues related to academic integrity.
* 5a\. Define academic integrity and articulate its importance in scholarly work.
* 5b\. Identify specific behaviors that constitute academic dishonesty, including but not limited to cheating on tests; turning in written or graphic work without citing correctly the sources of ideas, words, data, or images; collaborating with others on projects and homework where that is not allowed; and other behaviors described in the Collegeâ€™s handbook, _Academic Honesty: Scholarly Integrity, Collaboration, and the Ethical Use of Sources_.
* 5c\. Understand the procedures that would be initiated if suspected of academic dishonesty and the potential outcomes for violating the policy

**Anticipated uses**: We will use the results of this exercise in
our discussions of academic honesty.  You will also use some of the
guidance on citation in an upcoming writing exercise.
