**Background**: This semester, we will be looking both backwards
and forwards.  We look backwards to explore a variety of perspectives
on the liberal arts and on liberal education.  We look forwards to
imagine what a liberal education could or should be in this
no-longer-new century.  As you prepared for registration, you already
explored some perspectives on liberal education through Grinnell's
statements on liberal education and through William Cronon's "Only
Connect".  In this assignment, you will start to imagine how liberal
education might change.

**The Basics**: Pick one new thing you would recommend or require
as part of a liberal education in the 21st century (LE21) and write
an essay of approximately five-hundred words explaining why that
thing should be part of a liberal education.  You might, for example,
suggest that to be liberal educated, you must be able to write and
read computer programs, or have developed some basic understanding of
race and racism, or have developed habits of wellness, or ....

In writing your essay, you should also do your best to acknowledge the 
objections your readers might have to your suggestion or claim.

**Audience**: Your audience is other first-year college students
at Grinnell or elsewhere.  Your goal is to convince your reader
that they should undertake what you suggest, even if it is not part
of the requirements of their institution.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following goals of
Tutorial.

* 1.a. Employ a deliberate and iterative writing process that includes brainstorming, planning, gathering evidence, drafting, and revising
* 1.b. Make appropriate stylistic and rhetorical choices with regard to audience, purpose, and context for each piece of writing
* 1.c. Situate their own ideas within a critical conversation about a particular topic
* 6.a. Understand the [C]ollege's liberal arts philosophy
* 7.b. Suggest ways in which liberal education might (need to) change to adapt to America and the world in the 21st century.
* 7.c. Articulate and defend a personal vision of liberal education.

**Citations**

In writing your essay, you may find that you are relying on other
sources, such as Grinnell's statement about liberal education.  When
you rely on such sources, you should cite them.  For this essay,
you may use whatever citation style you learned before coming to
Grinnell; our primary goal is that you acknowledge the work of
others.

You need not cite the class discussions of these topics.  We will
treat those discussions as an implicit source.  (You may find that
other faculty may different perspectives on these issues.)

If you discuss your essay with others outside of class (and you should),
please add an acknowledgement of those discussions to the end of your
essay.

Note that your citations and acknowledgements do not count toward the
500-word length expectation.

**Preparatory process**

1. We will spend two minutes *individually brainstorming* potential
ideas for essay topics.

2. We will post those ideas on a shared white board.

3. We will look for any common themes or groupings.  For example, we might
note that multiple ideas relate to technology or to race.

4. We will quickly discuss the broad picture we see.

5. Each student will pick three of the ideas on the board.  Multiple
students may pick the same idea.

6. We will have three short free-writing sessions, one for each idea you
have picked.

**Primary process**

Over the next three or so days, you should plan to 

1. Meet with your class Writing Mentor.  You can decide where in the
process it is most appropriate to meet with your Writing Mentor.

2. Pick a new component of liberal education.  In most cases, it
will be one of the three you wrote about in class, but you may also
choose another one from the list we developed in class or even one
we did not discuss.

3. Reflect on reasons to require or recommend that new component.

4. Reflect on potential objections to that requirement/recommendation.

5. Draft your essay.  Some of you will find it easiest to write an
outline to guide your draft.  Others may prefer to free write and
then revise.  For this essay, I'd recommend that you follow a practice
you've found comfortable in the past.  (For other essays, I will
recommend that you try a different strategy.)

5. Finish your essay.  Again, practices vary.  Some of you may find
it best to discard the draft and start again.  Others may develop an
outline and rewrite based on that outline.

You are required to meet with a writing mentor somewhere in the
process.  Some will find it useful to discuss the structure of the
essay before drafting.  Others will find it more useful to draft
the essay and have a writing mentor review the draft before writing
the final version.  A few may even want the writing mentor to review
the "final" version in oreder to improve it.

Feel free to take advantage of your resources along the way.
particularly the class writing mentors, me, and your peers in the
class.  You will likely find it useful to have someone read and
discuss your draft with you.  But you may also want to discuss
broader issues of the new requirement/recommendation before you
start drafting.

**Postprocessing**

1. On Thursday, you will distribute your essays to your peers at the start of
class.

2. You will read each others' essays before class on Friday.

3. On Friday, we will discuss the essays and related issues that arose
in our work and reading.

**Additional notes**

* Please email me your essay as a Microsoft Word document.
* Make sure that your essay has a title.
* Make sure that your essay includes the traditional header: author, class, instructor, assignment, date (on separate lines).
* Make sure to number your pages.
