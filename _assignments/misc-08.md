**Background:** 

As scholars, we regularly generate new ideas, new information, new
perspectives, and new theories. It is our responsibility as citizens
of a greater community to share this new knowledge with other people.
We share knowledge in a wide variety of ways, including informal
conversation, formal discussion, essays, and notes.  While these
mechanisms all have value, we often find it especially valuable
to share our knowledge in spoken form, as a presentation.

As we have noted in class, a good presentation shares many
characteristics with a good essay. A good presentation is targeted
at a particular audience. A good presentation has a point. A good
presentation helps the audience learn something. A good presentation
engages the audience. A good presentation coheres. A great presentation
encourages the audience to explore the topic further.

At the same time, a good presentation may differ in many ways from
an essay. For example, some successful presentations use a much
less formal tone than do typical essays. (Some successful presentations
use a formal tone.) A good presentation makes explicit the varying
tones that may be less obvious in an essay. A good presentation may
incorporate a wider variety of media.

**Assignment:**

Prepare and give a fifteen minute presentation on your research
topic. Plan an additional five minutes for questions and answers.
Your colleagues will have another five to ten minutes to fill out
evaluation forms.

**Form:**

You are welcome to give your presentation in whatever form you deem
best. You might read directly from your essay. You might use note
cards to guide your general direction. You might ad lib.  Whatever
form you choose should demonstrate that you have thought carefully
about not only the topic but also how you will present the topic.

You also have freedom in the use of extra materials. You might use
PowerPoint. You might demonstrate something on the Web. You might
provide handouts.

I do, however, ask, that you present your topic in a way that compels
and teaches the audience.
