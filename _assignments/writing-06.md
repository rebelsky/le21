**The Assignment**: Write a moderately short (300-600 word) essay
in which you reflect on your strengths and weaknesses as a discussion
participant and discussion leader. You should also reflect on an
aspect or aspects of your work in discussion that you would most
like to improve. You might also reflect on how your skills or
approaches have changed since the start of the semester.

**Note**: Like all good essays, this essay should have an identifiable point.

**Resources**: Your first resource is yourself. You should be prepared to reflect on how you have participated in our topical discussions. Because I consider it useful for you to have external comments, I will regularly ask your classmates to comment on your skills as participant and leader in discussions. I may also provide you with my own comments.  You may also wish to talk to your classmates.  And you should certainly talk with your writing mentor about the structure of the paper, even though they will be unable to comment on your skills as a discussant.
