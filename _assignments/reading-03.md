**Background**: The Tutorial has one primary focus: Liberal education.
But we are also looking backwards (sideways?) at Grinnell's approach
and looking forward to what it might become.  In this assignment, you
will read a few short pieces to help ground our conversations.

**The Basics**: 

1. Read the following.

    * [The Tutorial Turns 40](http://web.grinnell.edu/Dean/Tutorial/History/Tutorial40.pdf)
    * [Adoption of the No-Requirements Curriculum](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/AcadProg/History_ofthe_No-Requirements_Curriculum_Clotfelter.pdf)
    * [How Can We Understand "Liberal Arts Education"?](https://mellon.org/news-blog/articles/how-can-we-understand-liberal-arts-education/)
    * [What should it mean to be liberally educated in the 21st century?](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher-ed-gamma/what-should-it-mean-be-liberally-educated-21st-century)

2. As you're reading, look for two sentences whose structure or style
you really like and one sentence you find confusing.

3. Post those sentences to the _Sentences, Good and Bad_ channel
on Teams, with each sentence as a separate post.  Make sure to give us 
enough information that we can find them in context.  

4. In the _Liberal Education_ channel on Teams, post three important points from
the readings that you'd like to remember.  Once again, write each point in a separate post.

**Audience**: Your audience for these notes is the rest of Tutorial.
That is me, your fellow Tutorial students, our Writing Mentors, and
the liaisons.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following [Tutorial
objectives](../handouts/objectives).

* 2\. Tutorial helps students develop critical reading skills through close reading of texts and analysis of materials.

**Anticipated uses**: We will use the results of this exercise in
further discussions of liberal education.  We may use your selected
sentences in rewriting exercises.
