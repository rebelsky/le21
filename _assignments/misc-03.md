**Background**: For much of the rest of the semester, you will work
with a topic you have chosen, developing deep knowledge about the topic
and sharing that knowledge through discussion, writing, and presentation.
Although it is relatively early in the semester, the time has come to
pick that topic.

**Assignment**: Identify two or three subjects related to our main
topics (Grinnell education and Liberal education in the 21st century)
that you think would be valuable to study and that you want to spend
much of the semester on.

**Process**:

1. Spend the next day or so reflecting on potential topics.  We may
or may not use class time on the subject.

2. Come up with a list of at least four potential topics before your
Wednesday meeting with Prof. Rebelsky.

3. Discuss those topics with Prof. Rebelsky to narrow the list.  In
our discussions, we will consider issues that include (a) relevance
to the broader goals of the Tutorial, (b) potential resources you can
rely upon in working with the material, and (c) likely depth of
the topic.

4. Pick two and post them to the Topics channel on Teams.  You may also
pick a new topic to post, but be prepared to discuss it with Prof.
Rebelsky.

**Some potential topics**

* Historical: The evolution of \[Tutorial, Convocation, Self-Governace, the Individually Advised Curriculum\].  This would likely draw upon the college archives and additional interviews that you (or others in the Tutorial) conduct.
* Historical: Evolving models and roles of liberal education.
* Current: The First-Year Experience.
* Connective: The roles of \[Tutorial, Convocation, Self-Governance, the Individually Advised Curriculum\] in liberal education.
* Comparative: Current models of "The Open Curriculum" (Grinnell, Hamilton, Brown, ...)
* Comparative: A comparative study of GenEd or Common-Core requirements.
* Comparative: Models of higher education (Liberal arts vs. vocational
  vs. "technology" vs. ....)
* Anticipatory: Extended narratives on new components of liberal
  education (race, communication beyond text/talking, wellness,
  globalism/globalization, etc.)
