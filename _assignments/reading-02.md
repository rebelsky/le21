**Background**: On the first day of class, we considered a high-level
overview of Tutorial.  In this assignment, you will explore some
additional details.

**The Basics**: 

1. Read the following.

    * The [Tutorial syllabus](../syllabus/)
    * The [appendices to the syllabus](../syllabus/appendices)
    * The [Tutorial handouts](../handouts)
    * The [Tutorial schedule](../schedule/)
    * Chapter 2 of _Style_.

2. As you're reading the Tutorial materials, look for two sentences 
you think I should rewrite.

3. Post those sentences to the _Sentences, Good and Bad_ channel
on Teams.  Make sure to give us enough information that we can find
them in context.  (E.g., "Notes on writing, second paragraph".)

4. Post any questions you have to the Questions channel.  (It's okay
if you don't have any.)

**Audience**: Your audience for these notes is the rest of Tutorial.
That is me, your fellow Tutorial students, our Writing Mentors, and
the liaisons.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following [Tutorial
objectives](../handouts/objectives).

* 2\. Tutorial helps students develop critical reading skills through close reading of texts and analysis of materials.
* 2e\. Assess the credibility of a text in terms of its methodology, evidence, reasoning, and sources

**Anticipated uses**: We will use the results of this exercise in
further discussions of the goals and structure of this tutorial.
We may use your selected sentences in rewriting exercises.  (I'll
also use them to improve the pages.)  The chapter from _Style_ will
lead to other exercises.
