Part One: Reflections and Writing on Liberal Education
------------------------------------------------------

My experience with Grinnell students is that they are happier with something to do.  So I'd like you to do some work before our first session.  Our Tutorial is on Liberal Education.  And the courses you choose are a way of helping attain that education.  So I'd like you to read, reflect, and write a bit before our first meeting.

a. Read the College's Mission Statement, available at <https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=26&navoid=4402>

b. Read the College's statement on Education in the Liberal Arts up to, but not including, "Ways of Learning", available at <https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=26&navoid=4400>.  If you want to read more, you can.

c. Read the College's list of College-wide learning outcomes, available at <https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/centers-programs/ctla/college-wide>.  You may, but need not, read the additional details.

d. Read William Cronon's "Only Connect", available at <http://www.williamcronon.net/writing/cronon_only_connect.pdf>.

e. Write two sentences that you could use to explain a liberal education or a liberal arts education to someone unfamiliar with the concept.

f. Write two sentences to explain how a Grinnell liberal education or a Grinnell liberal arts education might differ from a liberal education or liberal arts education at other small liberal arts colleges (SLACs, if you like acronyms).

g. Post your sentences in the cleverly-named "Sentences for 2020-07-27" channel.

Part Two: Course Exploration
----------------------------

Due Sunday night at 8pm (your local time).

I realize that you've already sent me a list of six courses.  (Or you should have.  I still haven't seen your forms.  As I said, I probably won't receive them until this weekend.).  But I'd like you to do a bit more exploration beyond what you've done already.

For this exercise, you should use the schedule of courses available online at <https://webadv-prod.ec.grinnell.edu/WAPROD/WAPROD?type=P&pid=ST-X3WSEI> and the descriptions available in the College catalog at <https://catalog.grinnell.edu/>.  If you'd prefer, you can use the catalog in the schedule planning tool.  Let me know if you have difficulty understanding how to use any of these sites.

a. Read through the descriptions of the special topics courses offered this year.  You can use the "search schedule of courses" tool, entering "ST" for course title keyword and "Special Topics" for course type.  Pick at least one you think would be interesting to you or to someone else.

b. Find a 300-level course that might be of interest (e.g., in a prospective major).

c. Trace the prerequisite chain for that 300-level course.  If "trace the prerequisite chain" makes no sense to you, ignore this step or reach out to me.

d. Reach out to at least to two Grinnell students or Grinnell alums and ask each to identify two or three courses they would recommend to others.  Be sure to understand why they would recommend those courses.  Note that these courses need not be courses you should take in your first semester. Rather, these should be courses that you should consider taking before you graduate.  Feel free to begin your message with "Professor Rebelsky gave me this strange assignment" or something similar.

How do you find people to reach out to?  You could ask me for recommendations.  You can look for someone from your home state or a major of interest in the campus directory at <https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/Private/asp/campusdirectory/GCdefault.asp> or the alumni directory at <https://alumni.grinnell.edu/>.  You could join the Grinnell-only social community at <https://grinnellplans.com> and figure out how to reach out to someone there.  (Grinnell Plans is mostly alums from 2000 to 2010, but there are folks from other class years there.)  You could rely on one of the too-many Grinnell-related Facebook groups.

I apologize for the "reach out to someone you've never met" approach.  Usually, I can rely on you having other students around you.  But it can be a good experience to find ways to meet other Grinnellians online.  If you are too uncomfortable reaching out to a current student or alum, let me know and I'll figure out an alternative task or I'll ask a current student or alum to reach out to you.

e. Post your course from (a), your course from (b), and at least two of your courses from (d) to the even-more-cleverly-named "Courses for 2020-07-27" channel.  Include a short explanation of why someone might want to take each course.
