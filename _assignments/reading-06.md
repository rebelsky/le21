**Background**: While most of us lack the time to read all of Bok, we
each have time to read one chapter.  So we will each read and summarize
for each other.  We will also look into other models of higher education.

**The Basics**: 

1. Read your assigned chapter of Derek Bok's _Higher Expectations_.  Ch 2: NS.  Ch 3: HU.  Ch 4: CS.  Ch 5: HB.  Ch 6: MY. Ch 7: ZF.  Ch 8: MW.  Ch 9: TJ.  Ch. 10: TM. Preface and Conclusion: JP.

2. Find the requirements for three different kinds of Colleges, such as

    * a requirements-focused liberal arts institution, like Columbia
    * a "technical" school, such as Rose Hulman, MIT, Caltech, or
      the Colorado school of mines.
    * a school with a "nontraditional" curriculum, such as Hampshire
      College.
    * a school with a Great Books program, such as St. John's.
    * a school with an open curriculum, such as Hamilton or Brown.
    * something else you come up with.

    Make sure that you pick schools that have not yet been posted to
    our _Curricula_ channel.

2. By 8pm Wednesday CDT, post a two-paragraph summary of your chapter to
the _Liberal Arts_ channel on Teams.

3. Before class time on Thursday, post at least four followup messages
on posts from other people.  You might comment on some aspect of the
summary or ask a question.  Strive to post to the less crowded
threads.  (We should average at least two four per thread.)

4. Before class time on Thurday, post links to the three curricula 
you identified.  If possible, use the A button to give a title to
each post (the name of the school and the type of school) and put 
the link in the body.

5. Be prepared to discuss all of the above, particularly your book
chapter and the details of the curricula you identified.

**Audience**: Your audience for these notes is the rest of Tutorial.
That is me, your fellow Tutorial students, our Writing Mentors, and
the liaisons.

**Target outcomes**: This assignment relates to the following [Tutorial
objectives](../handouts/objectives).

**Anticipated uses**: We will use the results of this exercise in
our discussion of the liberal arts.  You may use the ideas in writing
your longer research paper.
