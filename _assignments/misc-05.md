**Background**: As you know, one of the many goals of Tutorial is to
help you develop your oral communication skills.  In my experience, one
way you become a better discussion participant is to lead an academic
discussion.  In this assignment, you will prepare for and lead a
discussion about your primary essay topic.  Leading a discussion will
also help you think more carefully about your topic and, presumably,
allow you to develop a more complex discussion of that topic.

**Note**: Although this is listed as due on Friday of week three,
discussions will occur in week four of the class.  All that you need
to prepare for week three is a list of readings for your classmates
and the questions you would like me to ask.  

**Approximate process**:

1. Review your list of readings about this topic.

2. Choose between fifteen and thirty pages of reading for your classmates
that you think will ground a productive discussion.  Post links to those
readings in a channel to be named.

3. Post preliminary questions about those readings for your classmates.
It is fine if your preliminary question resembles my traditional
"Post two points you'd like to remember from the discussions."

4. Prepare the materials to lead discussion.

5. Lead a twenty-minute discussion on the topic.  During the first
five minutes of some discussions, a few members of class will be
serving as observers, taking notes on the structure of the conversation.

6. After each discussion, your peers will fill out a quick feedback
form.

7. Review the feedback forms as well as your own experience.  Then
reflect on your participation and leadership.
