## Overview

Welcome to the Fall 2020 session of one of the offerings of Tutorial from Grinnell College. The title of this particular tutorial is _The Open Curriculum, Tutorial, and Liberal Education in the 21st Centur_. As the title suggests, this Tutorial takes a somewhat self-reflexive approach.  We will consider the purposes of liberal education, explore how it might or should change in this century, and reflect on how Grinnell's Tutorial and Individually Advised (Open) Curriculum can contribute to a liberal education.  You can learn more about Tutorial from [an explanatory document](../handouts/tutorial).

In short, this semester we'll be working on building your skills in thinking, writing, reading, speaking, and working with sources while studying liberal education and considering and developing a variety of perspectives on liberal educatoin in the twenty-first century.

Our class will be dynamic; while the due dates of assignments are unlikely
to change, the particulars of each class session or assignment might.  You
should regularly check the course web, which you can find at 
<https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/Tutorial/2020F/>.

One of our goals this semester will be to produce a [book](../handouts/book)
about the topic of this Tutorial.  I will provide you with additional
information as the semester progresses.

## Some Basics

    * [Introductory essay](../assignments/writing-01) and
      [Followup essay](../assignments/writing-02) (10%)
    * [Interviews](../assignments/writing-03) (10%)
    * [Preliminary bibliography](../assignments/misc-04) and

    * [Introduction to or cover for class anthology](../assignments/writing-09) (10%)
  : To compensate for the occasional lapse, I will drop the lowest of those ten grades. To reward particularly strong work, I will count the best of the grades (excluding talks and participation) twice.
  : Students who do not attend their weekly meetings with the instructor and writing mentor will have their grade reduced by one letter.
  : Grading Scale A : 93--100%
    A-: 90--93%;
    B+: 87--90%;
    B: 83--87%;
    B-: 80--83%;
    C+: 77--80%;
    C: 70--77%;
    D: 60--70%;
    F: 0--60%

Late Work
  : Because I have found that students who turn in work late tend to dig themselves into deeper and deeper holes and because many of our in-class exercises will require the work due that day, I traditionally impose fairly severe penalties for late work.  Because of the complexities of the current time, I will not impose penalties on late work.  However, most class sesssions will depend on you having done the work; if I find that you are regularly turning in work late, we will need additional discussionts.

Contract
  : From experience, I know that some students are concerned about your ability to pass this Tutorial. Although I think you shouldn't be concerned, I also do my best to alleviate this concern by providing a form of "contract". If you (a) miss no more than one class; (b) turn in all your work on time; (c) participate regularly in class; and (d) try hard on everything, then I will guarantee you at least a C in the class.

### Accommodations

My goal is to help you learn as much as possible in this course;
please let me know what I can do meet your learning needs. If you
have a disability that requires accommodations, please contact [Disability
Services](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/accessibility-disability/disability-services).
Disability Resources will work with you to determine your needs,
and will provide you with paperwork outlining the accommodations you
require. Please give me this paperwork at least a week before the course
activity for which you need accommodations. If this timeline is not
feasible for any reason, please contact me as soon as possible and we
will work together to find a solution.

You can find additional information on my approaches to
accommodations in [an appendix to this syllabus](../syllabus/accommodations).

### Textbooks / references

Tutorial, more than most courses, mixes topical learning with the
development of skills.  Topical readings will be a variety of articles,
including articles selected by class members.  Three texts serve as
our primary resources for developing skills.

* Vincent Benlloch and Helen Eckhard (2017).  _The Grinnell College
  Guide to Writing, Research, and Speaking_.  Available online at
  <https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2020-01/Grinnell%20College%20Guide%20to%20Writing%2C%20Research%2C%20and%20Speaking.pdf>.
* Wayne Booth, Gregory G. Columb, and Joseph M. Williams (2008).  _The
  Craft of Research_, 3rd Edition.  Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago
  Press.
* Joseph Williams (1995). _Style: Toward Clarity and Grace_.
  Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press.

The grading scale for this course will be:


You may note that a score of exactly 90% could earn either a B+ or an A-. In
this unlikely scenario, I will always choose the higher of the two grades. I
also reserve the right to adjust this scale during the semester. You will be
notified of any changes, and the scale will not change in the final two weeks
of the course. You may ask me for your current grade in the class at any point;
I will happily give you my best estimate based on the current scale and graded
work so far, but *these estimates are not guarantees of a specific final grade*.

### Attendance

Your classmates and partner(s) depend on your contributions to learn
new material and complete the required work for this course. *Don't let
them down!* You are expected to arrive on time and participate actively
in every class.

### Participation

Because much of our work in this course involves collaboration and discussion, 
I will also evaluate you on your class participation.
Participating in class involves:

 - being present in class (physically and mentally)
 - coming to class on time
 - coming to class prepared
 - asking questions when appropriate
 - making positive contributions to class discussion by volunteering and when called upon
 - staying on task during lab exercises, and
 - working effectively with your colleagues.

Students who regularly meet these criteria can expect to earn an A- for
their participation grade. I will reward students who regularly provide
significant insights or guide discussion in productive ways with a higher
participation score. Students who fail to participate regularly (e.g.,
demonstrating a lack of preparation or involvement during class)
or who participate in counterproductive ways (e.g., by dominating the
conversation, making inappropriate comments, or getting off-task) can
expect to earn a lower score.

## Academic honesty

As students, you are members of the academic community. Both the College and I
expect the highest standards of academic honesty, [as explained in the Grinnell
College Student
Handbook](https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2537#Honesty
_in_Academic_Work).

We will spend a reasonable amount of time in this Tutorial discussing 
issues of academic honesty.
