---
You will be randomly assigned a partner.  Each of you will select one
paragraph that you will work on together.  One of you will be the
designated "Writer" and the other the designated "Editor".

1. Pick the longest paragraph in a recent essay.  This semester, I would
recommend that you pick use one of (a) your discussion reflection, (b)
your introduction, (c) whatever you're written for your longer essay.

2. Writer and Editor: Separately read through the paragraph, marking
the topic string of each sentence and making a list of thematic
strings (grouped by category).

3. Compare your lists.  

4. Writer (in conversation with Editor): Decide on a list of topic strings.

5. Writer (in conversation with Editor): Decide on your lists of
thematic strings.

6. Writer and Editor (separately): Rewrite the issue to place the topic
and theatic strings in the proper place.

7. Compare your issues.

8. As time permits, rewrite each sentence to better incorporate the
topic strings and thematic strings.

Just in case you've forgotten, here's what Williams and Columb give
as the basic priciples of coherence.

1. A cohesive paragraph has consistent topic strings.

2. A cohesive paragraph has another set of strings running through it
tha we will call _thematic strings_.

3. A cohesive paragraph introuces nw topic and thematic strings in a
predictable location: at the end of [the _issue_,] the sentence(s)
that introduce the paragraph.

4. A coherent paragraph will usually have a single sentence that
clearly articulates its point.

5. A coherent paragraph will typically locate that point sentence
in one of two places[: at the end of the issue or the end of the
discussion].

> _Style_, pp. 81--82

Williams and Columb also provide alternate versions of thise.

1. Readers will feel that a paragraph is cohesive if it has
consistent topic strings. [p. 82]

2. A reader will feel that a paragraph is cohesive if it has
other strngs of related words, strings that we will call
_thematic strings_.  [p. 83]

3. A reader will feel that a paragraph is cohesive if he is
introduced to a new topic and thematic strings in a predictable
location: at the end of the sentence(s) that constitute the opening
sectionf of a paragraph, section, or whole document. [p. 87]

4. A reader will feel that a paragraph is coherent if she
can read a sentence that specifically articulates its point. [p. 97]

5. A reader will feel that a paragrpah is coherent if he finds
the _point_ sentence in one of two predictable places in a paragraph:
(1) at the end of its issue, or (2) at the end of its discussion; 
i.e. at the end of the paragraph (or section or whole document). [p. 99]
