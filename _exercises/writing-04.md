1. Make the following sentence more concise.

    > In order to move forward with this argument, one must first understand the following: In my vast experience, it has often been claimed that the speedily quick brownish-colored member of the vulpine family appears to have leaped above, over, and superior to the canine who basically lacked initiative and willpower, thereby exhausting the elements of the keyboard.

2. Write at least three concise (fifteen to twenty words) but interesting sentences about your topic.

3. Make those sentences more verbose by applying some of the techniques that you learned.  Have fun with this!
    * Redundant pairs (e.g., full and complete)
    * Redundant modifiers (e.g., past memories)
    * Redundant categories (e.g., shiny in appearance)
    * Meaningless modifieres (e.g., basically, definitely)
    * Pompous diction (e.g., utilize rather than use)
    * Belaboring the obvious (e.g., engaged in the activity of learning)
    * Irrelevant detail.
    * A phrase for a word (e.g., due to the fact that rather than because)
    * Metadiscourse (i.e., writing about your writing)
    * Hedges (e.g., apparently, seemingly)
    * Sequencers and topicalizers (e.g., In the next section,)
    * Negating the negative (e.g., Don't write in the negative.)

4. Post three of your extended sentences to the shared document.

5. Rewrite three of the extended sentences as assigned.

6. Be prepared to share you sentences and any general thoughts with 
the group.
