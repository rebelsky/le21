_Note that Sam, Helen, and Delaney will be available during these
exercises to answer questions and provide suggestions._

**Round 1A**

You have been assigned a partner.  In the first stage of round 1,
partner A will serve as writing mentor for partner B.  In the second
stage of round 1, you will switch roles.

The student will pick some part of the larger essay that would
benefit from advice.  The mentor will do best to help the student
move forward by asking questions, making suggestions, and all the
other wonderful things your writing mentors do.  

I suggest that the student begin by reading part of the essay aloud.

You have fifteen minutes.

**Round 1B**

Switch roles and repeat the mentoring session process.

You have fifteen minutes.

**Intermezzo**

You will have about forty-five minutes to work on your essay.  You
might choose to work on the issues you discussed with your mentor;
you might choose to work on some other aspect of the essay.  Feel free
to ask Helen, Delaney, or Sam to consult along the way.

**Round 2A**

You have been assigned a new partner.  Once again, Partner A will 
serve as mentor for fifteen minutes, providing advice for Partner B.

If the student has been working on the issue discussed in round 1,
they might ask for additional advice on the revised portion or about
another issue in the paper.  If the student has been working on
other aspects of the paper, they can ask about the new aspect they
have been working on or on some third part of the essay.

You have fifteen minutes.

**Round 2B**

Switch roles.  Follow the basic mentor session advice from above.

You have fifteen minutes.
