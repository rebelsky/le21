_This is a think/pair/share assignment.  First you will do some work yourself.
Then you will work with one other student.  Then we will share as a class._

**Think (Individual)**

You should have brought your course syllabi (or a summary thereof) to today's class. 

1. Get out your syllabi and notes.  (Alternately, go find them online.)

2. Make a copy of [a simple calendar grid](https://grinco-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/rebelsky_grinnell_edu/EQa_FpD07ptDorFhmNx05wEBrhMwE8b3DzFqYUnkEqjsnQ?e=NHLc9R).

3. Plot each major assignment on the calendar grid that was distributed with this exercise.

4. Pick two major assignments and plot on the grid when you plan to work on them and what work you intend to do.

5. Pick at least two or three things from your syllabi that you'd consider particularly important to share with someone else in your classes who had not read the the syllabus.

**Pair**

1. Tell your colleagues something you learned in gathering and reading your syllabi. As a group, pick two or three particularly useful lessons that you'd like to share more broadly.

2. Pick one or two of your major assignments and discuss with your colleagues (a) how much work you think you'll have to do for the assignment and (b) when you intend to do the work.  These can be those you did above or others.

3. Appoint one group member to talk about #1 and one group member to talk about #2.

**Share**

Be ready to talk about all of the above.
